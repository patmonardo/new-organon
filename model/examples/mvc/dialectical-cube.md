# The Dialectical Cube (3³ Fabric)

## The Matrix

| Dimension | Immediacy (Being) | Mediation (Essence) | Unity (Concept) |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| **Logic** | Being             | Essence             | Concept         |
| **Model** | Model             | View                | Controller      |
| **Task**  | Task              | Agent               | Workflow        |

## The Logic of Action (Concept + Kriya)

The **Concept of Action** is Three-Dimensional (U-P-S):

- **Universality (U)**: The Principle / The Plan
- **Particularity (P)**: The Means / The Tool
- **Singularity (S)**: The Execution / The Result

This gets crossed into the **Absolute Concept** to generate the **Active Pure Concept**, which is raised to the **Idea** through **Objectivity**.
