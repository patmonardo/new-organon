# Strategic Direction: Beyond "Semantic Data Analysis"

## The Realization

**Malloy was a speculative bubble** - We explored it, but descending from Semantic Web to Malloy "Semantic Modeling" is really a step down for us.

## Our Position

### Not Building a "Semantic Data Analysis Workstation"

**We're not:**
- Building analyst workstations
- Competing with data analysis tools
- Creating "Semantic Data Analysis" platforms
- Following the Malloy path

**We are:**
- Building higher-level semantic systems
- Working with Semantic Web concepts (OWL/SHACL/SPIN/SPARQL)
- Focusing on Form Application Server architecture
- Using AI MultiAgent systems for semantic drilldown

## The Future: AI MultiAgent Semantic Drilldown

**Prediction:** AI MultiAgent Semantic Drilldown "experts" will win out on compile client analyst stations.

**What this means:**
- Traditional analyst workstations will be replaced
- AI agents will handle semantic exploration
- Multi-agent systems will provide expert-level analysis
- No need for human-driven "semantic modeling" tools

## Malloy as Future Adapter (Unlikely)

**Could be:**
- A separate MVC adapter in the future
- Useful if specific integration needs arise

**But:**
- Unlikely to be needed
- AI agents will handle the analysis layer
- Our stack (SDSL + Polars + DuckDB + Rust GDS) meets our needs

## Our Stack Focus

### What We're Building

**Form Application Server Standard Edition:**
- Higher-level semantic processing
- Form-based architecture
- Entity:Property:Relation semantics
- Shape:Context:Morph transformations
- OpenCypher IR for ontology
- Rust GDS for graph/ML

**Not:**
- Data analysis workstations
- "Semantic modeling" tools
- Analyst-focused platforms

### Execution Layer

**Our stack:**
- **SDSL** - Our semantic layer (not Malloy)
- **Polars** - DataFrame operations
- **DuckDB** - SQL analytics
- **Postgres** - Persistent storage
- **Rust GDS** - Graph/ML via Absolute Logic

**This meets our needs** - We're not competing with enterprise data analysis tools.

## Key Insight

**From Semantic Web to Malloy is a step down:**
- Semantic Web: OWL/SHACL/SPIN/SPARQL (higher-level)
- Malloy: "Semantic Modeling" (data analysis focus)
- We're building at the Semantic Web level, not the data analysis level

**AI agents will handle the analysis:**
- Multi-agent systems for semantic drilldown
- Expert-level analysis without human workstations
- Compile-time client analysis (not runtime workstations)

## Strategic Focus

### What We Build
1. **Form Application Server** - Core platform
2. **Semantic Web integration** - OWL/SHACL/SPIN/SPARQL
3. **Graph/ML capabilities** - Rust GDS
4. **AI MultiAgent systems** - Semantic drilldown experts

### What We Don't Build
1. **Data analysis workstations** - AI agents will replace
2. **"Semantic modeling" tools** - Step down from Semantic Web
3. **Analyst-focused platforms** - Not our target

## The Path Forward

**Continue with:**
- SDSL (our semantic layer)
- Polars + DuckDB + Postgres + Rust GDS
- Semantic Web concepts (OWL/SHACL/SPIN/SPARQL)
- Form Application Server architecture
- AI MultiAgent integration

**Avoid:**
- Malloy-style "semantic modeling"
- Data analysis workstation focus
- Competing with enterprise analysis tools

**Future adapter (if needed):**
- Malloy could be a separate MVC adapter
- But unlikely to be needed
- AI agents will handle analysis layer

## Conclusion

**Our stack is correct:**
- SDSL + Polars + DuckDB + Rust GDS
- Semantic Web level (not data analysis level)
- AI MultiAgent for semantic drilldown
- Form Application Server architecture

**Malloy was research, not direction:**
- Explored it
- Decided it's a step down
- Not building that path
- AI agents will replace analyst workstations anyway

**Focus on what matters:**
- Higher-level semantics
- Form-based architecture
- AI MultiAgent systems
- Our stack meets our needs
