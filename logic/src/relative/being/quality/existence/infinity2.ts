  Infinity — C. INFINITY: THE DETERMINATION OF BEING (Section c)

  This module covers section c: Affirmative infinity (the true infinite)
  - Reciprocal truth implicit in alternation
  - Immediate determinations: mutual inclusion
  - "And" joining yields two finites
  - Two paths (relation vs separation) → same result
  - "Scandalous" unity; qualitative determinacies negated
  - Double unity: finitized infinite, infinitized finite
  - Understanding's falsification
  - Each is unity by self-sublation (no external power)
  - Sublation ≠ alteration; empty beyond returns
  - Both share negation-of-negation → mediated self-affirmation
  - Both negated and posed distinct; connection already present
  - Cycle from finite: transcend → infinite → new limit → finite (self-closing)
  - Cycle for infinite: new limit → sublation → same infinite (no advance)
  - Each returns-through-negation; negation-of-negation; both are results
  - Indifference of starting point; double meaning; result = infinite
  - Infinite lowers to one side, elevates via mediation → true infinite
  - True infinite as becoming (not static unity)
  - True infinite is Dasein (negation of negation, determinateness present)
  - Bad infinite = unattainable beyond (defect)
  - Images: straight line (bad) vs circle (true)
  - True infinite as higher reality (essence/concept/idea)
  - Ideality: finite as moment in true infinite
  - Misopposition: real(finite) vs ideal(infinite) → bad infinite

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **The True Infinite**:
     The alternation already contains the truth implicitly. Comparing the two moments
     yields their unity—the concept. The "unity of finite and infinite" is an uneven
     expression; its correction appears in the true infinite.

  2. **Mutual Inclusion**:
     Each contains the other's determinateness. Saying "infinite" (negation of finite)
     already says "finite." Neither can be posited without the other. If separated by
     "and," each becomes finite—we have only two finites.

  3. **The "Scandalous" Unity**:
     The unity embraces both finite and infinite, but negates their qualitative determinacies.
     This resolves (rather than preserves) the contradiction. Do not carry over separated
     qualities into the unity—the unity negates those qualities.

  4. **Self-Sublation**:
     Each is itself the unity only as a sublating of itself. No external power—the finite's
     infinity consists in self-sublation. The infinite contains its other essentially.
     This is internal self-sublation, not alteration.

  5. **The Cycle**:
     From finite: transcend → infinite → new limit → finite (self-closing). From infinite:
     new limit → sublation → same infinite (no advance). Each returns to itself through
     negation—both are results, not initial determinations.

  6. **True Infinite as Becoming**:
     The true infinite is not a motionless "unity of finite and infinite." It is essentially
     becoming—now with finite and infinite themselves as moments in becoming. As negation
     of negation, it is Dasein (determinateness present).

  7. **Bad vs True Infinite**:
     Bad infinite = unattainable beyond (straight line to remote ends). True infinite =
     circle—self-return, closed presence, without beginning or end. The infinite is the
     real (not the finite); reality deepens as essence/concept/idea.

  8. **Ideality**:
     Negation is determined as ideality. The finite, as present in the true infinite, is
     idealized: a determination/content, distinct but not subsistent—only a moment. Opposing
     "real finite" to "ideal infinite" restates the bad infinite.
