the qualitative nature of the material something

The volume, the idealized element, is the one to be taken as unit,

which in quantitative determinateness

The purely qualitative relating of the two determinacies
of magnitude in a ratio of powers has disappeared,

would the weight of the mixture remain equal to the said sum

would remain equal to the sum of the two spaces.
But only the weight of the mixture is found
to be in fact the sum of the weights present prior to combination;
the side capable of addition is the one which,
as the one existing for itself,
has attained stability of being

the weight of matter, or, what amounts to the same thing from
a quantitative standpoint, the aggregate of material parts.
Alteration falls instead in the exponents,

of its being-for-itself as relations of measure,

to accidental alteration by an increase which is summed,
this being-for-itself proves at the same time to be
a negating factor with respect to this externality.
Since this immanent determining of the quantitative element
cannot appear, as we have seen, in the weight,
it turns up in the other quality

It might be surprising to sense-perception
that, upon the mixing of two specifically diverse materials,
what results is an alteration of the total volume,
normally a diminution of it,

otherwise existing outside one another.
But this stability, in face of the negativity
which is in the being-for-itself,

an idealization.`,

neutrality with the others constitutes,
however, its real comparison with them;
it is its comparison with them through itself.
The exponents of these ratios are however diverse,

its qualitative exponent as the series of
these different amounts of which it is the unit;
a series of specific ways of relating to others.
As one immediate quantum, the qualitative exponent
expresses one single relation.
The independent measure truly differentiates itself
in the characteristic series of exponents

other equally independent measures;

any other and taken as a unit, forms another series.

    text: `Now inasmuch as this independent measure produces
a series of exponents with a series of such independent measures,
it appears at first, when compared with another
independent measure outside this series itself,
that it is differentiated from it by virtue of
the fact that this other independent measure produces
another series of exponents with the same measures opposite to it.
But in this way these two independent measures
would not be comparable,
not in so far as each is regarded as a unit
with respect to its exponents,
and the two series thus resulting on the basis
of this connection of unit and exponents
do not differ in any determinate way.
The two measures which, as independent,
are supposed to be compared,
are at first differentiated from each other only as quanta;
in order that their ratio be determined,
the ratio requires a unit which exists for itself
and is common to both.
This determinate unit is to be sought, as shown,
only where the specific existence of
the two independent measures to be compared
is to be found, namely in the ratio
which the exponents of the ratio of
the series have to each other.
But this ratio of the exponents is
itself a unit existing for itself
and in fact determinate only in so far as the members of
the series have it as a constant ratio between them;
in that way it can be their common unit.
In it alone, therefore, lies the possibility of comparing
the two independent measures which were assumed not
to neutralize each other but to be rather reciprocally indifferent.
Each, taken by itself outside the comparison,
is the unit of the ratios that it establishes
with the opposite members:
these are the amounts relative to this unit
and hence represent the series of exponents.
But conversely, this series is the unit
for the two independent measures which
when compared with each other are as quanta to each other;
as such they are themselves different amounts
of their just indicated unit.`,
    summary: 'Independent measure produces series with series of measures. Compared with another outside series, differentiated by different series. But not comparable as units. Two measures differentiated as quanta; ratio requires common unit. Common unit = ratio of exponents of series (constant ratio between members). In this alone = possibility of comparing. Each = unit of ratios with opposite members (series of exponents). Series = unit for two measures (as quanta, different amounts of unit).'

or rather indefinitely many reciprocally opposing
and contrasting measures
yield the series of the exponents of
the ratio of these same measures,
are equally independent in themselves;
each is a specific something with its own relevant measure-relation.
To this extent, they are similarly to be taken each as a
unit so that they have a series of exponents in
the two or rather the indeterminate plurality of measures,
which are first named and compared only among themselves,
and these exponents are the comparative numbers of
precisely these named measures;
conversely, the comparative numbers of the independent measures
now taken singly are similarly the series of the
exponents for the members of the first series.
In this way, both sides are a series in which,
first, each number is simply a unit with respect to the
opposite series in which it has its specifically
determined being as a series of exponents;
second, each number is itself one of the exponents
for each member of the opposite series;
and, third, it is a comparative number for
the rest of the numbers of its series

to it also as an exponent,
it has its unit, determined for itself,

    text: `In this relation there is a return to the mode
in which quantum was posited as existing for itself,
namely as degree, as being simple
and yet having the magnitude of its determinateness
in a quantum that exists outside it,
one which is a circle of quanta.
In measure, however, this externality is not
merely a quantum and a circle of quanta,
but a series of numerical ratios,
and it is in the entirety of these that
the being-determined-for-itself of measure lies.
Just as it is the case in the being-for-itself of quantum as degree,
the nature of the independent measure has turned into this self-externality.
Its self-reference is at first an immediate relation,
and by that very fact its indifference to an other
lies only in the quantum.
Hence its qualitative side falls in this externality,
and its relating to the other becomes
that which constitutes the specific determination
of this independent measure.
Such a determination thus consists solely
in the quantitative mode of this relating,
and this mode is determined just as much by the other
as by the measure itself,
and this other is a series of quanta
while the measure, for its part,
is one such quantum.
But this connection in which two specific measures
specify themselves in a third thing (the exponent) further entails that,
in the exponent, the one measure has not gone over into the other;
that there is not, therefore, only one negation,
but that in the connection the two measures are
rather each negatively posited,
and since each preserves itself in it indifferently,
their negation is itself also negated.
This, their qualitative unity, is thus
an exclusive unit existing for itself.
It is only in this moment of exclusion
that the exponents, at first comparative numbers,
first gain in them the determinateness
truly specifying them reciprocally
and their difference thus becomes of qualitative nature.
But such a difference has a quantitative basis:
first, the independent measure relates to a plurality
of its qualitatively other side only because
in this relating it is at the same time indifferent;
second, this neutral connection is in virtue of
its quantitative basis not only alteration
but is now posited as a negation of the negation
and as exclusive unit.
Consequently, the affinity of an independent measure
with the plurality of measures of the other side is
no longer an indifferent connection but an elective affinity.`,
    summary: 'Return to degree: quantum existing for itself, simple, magnitude in quantum outside (circle of quanta). In measure: externality = series of numerical ratios. Being-determined-for-itself in entirety of these. Independent measure = self-externality. Self-reference = immediate relation, indifference only in quantum. Qualitative side falls in externality, relating to other = specific determination. Determination = quantitative mode of relating. Two measures specify in third (exponent); each negatively posited, negation negated. Qualitative unity = exclusive unit. In exclusion, exponents gain determinateness specifying reciprocally, difference = qualitative. Difference has quantitative basis. Affinity = elective affinity (not indifferent).'

essentially in the connection with its other;
it exists concretely only as this non-indifference.
Moreover, this specific connection is bound up with quantity
and is at the same time not only a connection with a single other,
but with a series of such non-indifferent matters
standing over and against it;
combinations with this series rest on a so-called affinity
with every member of the series,

We now have to consider this connection of opposite determinations.

exhibited in a circle of combinations;
the meaning of a single note also depends on its relation to,

the harmony or disharmony in such a circle of combinations
constitutes its qualitative nature

that form a series of exponents,

what each of the combined notes is within it.
The single note is the keynote of a system,

the system of every other note.

a mere quantitative progression.`,

in the way it relates to the whole of an opposite series,
the members of which differ from each other only by virtue of
the quantum required for being neutralized with that member,
the more specific determinateness in this manifold affinity
is likewise only quantitative.
In elective affinity which is an exclusive, qualitative connection,
the relating escapes this quantitative difference.
The next determination which offers itself is this:
that in accordance with the difference in the number,
hence the extensive magnitudes,
of the members of one side required
for the neutralization of a member in another side,
the elective affinity of this member would be directed
to the members of the first series with all of which it has affinity.
Thus transformed, the exclusion that would thereby be established
in the form of a firmer bonding against other possibilities of combination
would appear in a proportionally greater intensity,
in keeping with the previously demonstrated identity
of the forms of extensive and intensive magnitude,
inasmuch as the determinateness of magnitude is in both one and the same.
However, this sudden conversion of the one-sided form
of extensive magnitude also into its other,
the intensive form, changes nothing in so far as
the nature of the fundamental determination is concerned,
which is one and the same quantum.
In fact, therefore, no exclusiveness would thereby be posited,
but instead of one single bonding
a combination of any number of members
could just as well take place,
provided that the portions of such members
entering into the combination corresponded to
the required quantum proportionately
to the ratios between them.`,

the exponent is essentially a determination of measure

On this side of exclusive relating,
numbers have lost their continuity

their relating is one of more or less,
and this acquires a negative character;
and the advantage that one exponent has over another
does not remain confined to the determinateness of magnitude.
Also equally present is the other side
which makes it again a matter of indifference
to a moment of measure whether it receives its
neutralizing quantum from several opposite moments,
from each according to the determinateness
that specifies it as against an other;
the exclusive, negative relating is at the same time
vulnerable to this incursion of the quantitative side.
What is posited here is thus the sudden conversion of an indifferent,
merely quantitative relating into a qualitative one,

into merely external relation,
a series of relations, sometimes of a merely quantitative nature,
sometimes specific relations and measures.`,
