Something, or a quality, based on such a ratio

Magnitude is that constitutional aspect

    text: `In the sphere of existence, the qualitative infinite
was the irruption of the infinite into the finite,
the immediate transition and vanishing of
the "this here" into its "beyond there."
In contrast to it, the quantitative infinite is
in its very determinateness the continuity of quantum,
its continuing beyond itself.
The qualitatively finite becomes infinite;
the quantitatively finite is its beyond in it:
it points beyond itself.
But this infinite of the specification of measure posits
both the qualitative and the quantitative as
each sublating itself into the other,
and it thereby posits their first immediate unity,
which is measure in general, as returned into itself
and consequently as itself posited.
The transition of the qualitative,
of one specific concrete existence into another,
is such that what happens is only
an alteration of magnitude determinateness;
the alteration of the qualitative
as such into the qualitative is thus posited as
an external and indifferent alteration,
as a coming together with itself;
the quantitative, for its part,
sublates itself by suddenly turning into the qualitative,
that is, a being which is determined in-and-for-itself.
This unity which thus continues in itself
in its alternating measures is
the self-subsistent matter that truly persists,
the fact.`,

Transition of qualitative = alteration of magnitude determinateness. Qualitative→qualitative = external/indifferent alteration, coming together with itself.

    title: 'Progressive determination summary — measure demoted to moment',
    text: `In reviewing the progressive determination
which measure has gone through,
the moments of the progression can be summed up as follows.
Measure is at first itself
the immediate unity of quality and quantity
in the form of a common quantum
which is, however, specific.
As a determinateness of quantity
which does not refer to an other but refers to itself,
measure is thus essentially a ratio.
Consequently, it also holds its moments
as sublated and unseparated in itself;
as is always the case in a concept,
the difference in the ratio is such
that each of its moments is itself the unity of
the qualitative and the quantitative moment.
The difference is thus real,
and it yields a multitude of measure-relations
which, as formal totalities,
are each self-subsistent in themselves.
The series which form the two sides of these ratios
are for each single member the same constant ordering
by which the member, as belonging to the one side,
relates itself to the whole series standing opposite it.
This ordering, although a mere order,
a still wholly external unity,
demonstrates itself to be,
as the immanently specifying unity of a measure
which has a determinate being-for-itself,
distinguished from its specifications;
but this specifying principle is not yet the free concept,
which alone gives its differences an immanent determination;
the principle is at first, rather, only a substrate,
a matter, for whose differences, in order that they be totalities,
that is, that they should have in themselves the nature
of their stable, self-equal substrate,
there is only available the external quantitative determination
which shows itself at the same time to be a qualitative differentiation.
In this self-unity of the substrate
the determination of measure is a sublated determination,
its quality an external state determined by quantum.
This course is equally the progressive determination
of measure and its demotion to a moment.`,
    summary: 'Progressive determination: Measure = immediate unity of quality and quantity (common quantum, specific). Measure = ratio (determinateness referring to itself). Holds moments as sublated/unseparated. Difference real, yields multitude of measure-relations (formal totalities, self-subsistent). Series = constant ordering. Ordering = immanently specifying unity, but principle = substrate/matter. Differences have only external quantitative determination (qualitative differentiation). In self-unity: measure determination = sublated, quality = external state determined by quantum. Course = progressive determination of measure + demotion to moment.'
