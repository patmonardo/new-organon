Present for this differentiation are
the two determinations contained
in the measure, quality and quantity,

But this is in turn determined by the fact that
the substrate is at first posited as result
and, though in itself mediation,
this mediation is not yet posited as such in it;
for this reason, it is in the first instance substrate
and, with respect to determinateness, indifference.`,

the implicitly existent absolute limit which,
as connected to those differences,
would not itself be in itself a quantum,

into opposition with others,
whether as sum or also as exponent,
be those others sums or indifferences.
It is only the abstract determinateness
which falls into the indifference;
the two quanta, in order that
they may be posited in it as moments,
are alterable, indifferent, greater or smaller
relative to one another.
However, inasmuch as they are restricted
by the fixed limit of their sum,
they are at the same time related to
each other not externally, but negatively,
and this is now the qualitative determination
in which they stand to each other.
Accordingly, they stand in inverse ratio to each other.
This relation differs from the earlier formal inverted ratio
inasmuch as the limit is here a real substrate,
and each of the two sides is posited as
having to be in itself the whole.`,

The implicit being of indifference

sides of the relation constitutes the mode of their subsistence;
their existence is by virtue of this indifference

But they do have a subsistence of their own in themselves,
one that differs from this quantitative existence,
for they are in themselves the indifference itself,
each the unity itself of the two qualities

The difference of the two moments is restricted by
the fact that the one quality is posited
on the one side with a more

in inverse order accordingly.
Each side is thus in it the totality of the indifference.
Each of the two qualities taken singly for itself

it continues from one side into the other

At this, the determinations come into immediate opposition,
an opposition which develops into contradiction,
as we must now see.`,

this connection also is supposed to be only a quantitative difference.
If the two qualities are both self-subsistent

then the whole determinateness of indifference falls apart;
their unity and totality would be empty names.
But they are at the same time determined as

each having meaning and reality only in this one
qualitative connecting reference to the other.
But now, because their quantitativeness is simply
and solely of this qualitative nature,
 each reaches only as far as the other.
If they are assumed to differ as quanta,
then the one would reach beyond the other

which the other would not have.
As qualitatively connected, however,
each is only in so far as the other is.
The result is that they are in equilibrium,
so that to the extent that one increases or decreases,
the other likewise increases or decreases
and would do so in the same proportion.`,
    summary: 'Each quality enters each side in connection with other (supposed quantitative difference). If both self-subsistent, determinateness falls apart, unity/totality empty names.

    text: `On the basis, therefore, of their qualitative connection,
there is no question of a quantitative difference
or of a more of the one quality.
The more by which the one of the two connected moments
would exceed the other would be only an unstable determination,
or would only be the other itself again;
but, in this equality of the two, neither would then be there,
for their existence would have to rest on the inequality of their quantum.
Each of these supposed factors vanishes,
whether the one factor is assumed
to exceed the other or to be equal to it.
From the standpoint of quantitative representation,
the vanishing appears as a disturbance of the equilibrium,
one factor becoming greater than the other;
the sublation of the quality of the other
and its instability are thus posited;
the first factor becomes the predominant one
as the other diminishes with accelerated velocity
and is overcome by it;
this in turn constitutes itself as the one self-subsistent factor;
with this, however, there are no longer two specific moments
as factors but only the one whole.

This unity thus posited as the totality
of the process of determining,
itself determined in this process as indifference,
is a contradiction all around.
It must therefore be posited
as this self-sublating contradiction,
and be determined as subsistence existing for itself,
one which no longer has a merely indifferent unity
for result but a unity immanently negative and absolute.
This is essence.`,
    summary: 'On basis of qualitative connection: no quantitative difference, no more of one quality. More exceeding other = unstable determination or other itself. In equality, neither there (existence rests on inequality). Each factor vanishes (exceeds or equal). Vanishing = disturbance of equilibrium, one factor greater, other quality sublated, first predominant, other diminishes, becomes self-subsistent factor, no longer two moments but one whole. Unity as totality of determining process, determined as indifference = contradiction all around. Must be posited as self-sublating contradiction, determined as subsistence existing for itself, unity immanently negative and absolute = essence.'
