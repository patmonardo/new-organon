/**
 * Logical Operations: Relation of Outer and Inner

 * The Relation of Outer and Inner is the completion of the essential relation,

 * Dialectical Movement:
 * - Reflective shine: mediation
 * - One identity: inner and outer
 * - Actuality: self-revealing essence

But in essential relation, self-subsistence is negative unity, posited in expression of force. Reflected unity essentially becoming-other, translation into externality. Externality immediately taken back into unity. Difference of self-subsisting forces sublates itself. Expression of force only mediation of reflected unity with itself. Present is empty and transparent difference, reflective shine. Shine is mediation which is independent subsistence. Not just transition. Immediacy itself only posited. Each determination already in immediacy unity with other. Transition equally self-positing turning back into itself.',
