  Relation of Outer and Inner — C. RELATION OF OUTER AND INNER

  This module translates the Outer-Inner section:
  - Force expression: empty transparent difference, reflective shine
  - Inner: form of reflected immediacy/essence
  - Outer: form of being
  - One identity: the fact (substrate replete of content)
  - Each immediately the other: inner is outer, outer is inner
  - Totality: each is totality through its other
  - Essence is self-revealing: externality is expression of essence
  - Transition to Actuality: essential relation determined as actuality

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Completion of Essential Relation**:
     Force expression is empty transparent difference, reflective shine - mediation which
     is independent subsistence. Not just opposite determinations sublating themselves,
     not only transition. Immediacy from which start was made is itself only posited.
     Each determination is already in its immediacy unity with its other - transition is
     self-positing turning back into itself. This completes Essential Relation.

  2. **The Absolute Square of Opposition Completed: Inner ↔ Form, Outer ↔ Matter**:
     This completes the Absolute Square of Opposition for the System of Marks:
     
     **Foundation (Mystical/Metaphysical):**
     - Identity : Difference → Whole : Parts
     
     **Ground (Mystical/Metaphysical):**
     - Form : Matter → Inner : Outer
     
     **Analogical Mapping:**
     - **Inner ↔ Form**: Inner is form of reflected immediacy, form of essentiality.
       Form (from Ground) is the determining, essential principle. Inner is the form
       of immanent reflection - the essential, determining side.
     
     - **Outer ↔ Matter**: Outer is form of being, form of immediacy reflected into
       other, form of unessentiality. Matter (from Ground) is the passive substrate.
       Outer is the manifold determined being - the unessential, external side.
     
     This completes the systematic mapping: Form-Matter (Ground) becomes Inner-Outer
     (Essential Relation) in the world of appearance. The "most important and interesting
     of the Dyads of Essence" - the completion of the Absolute Square of Opposition.

  3. **One Identity: The Fact**:
     Inner and outer are only one identity. This identity is sustaining unity as substrate
     replete of content - absolute fact. Two determinations are indifferent, external
     moments. It is content and totality - inner that has become outer but in outer is
     self-equal (not something-that-has-become). Outer equals inner according to content
     - two are only one fact. Fact as simple identity is different from form determinations
     - itself an inner different from externality. But externality consists in two
     determinations (inner and outer) - fact is unity of two. Two sides are same according
     to content. In fact they are self-penetrating identity, substrate full of content.
     In externality, as forms of fact, they are indifferent to identity, each indifferent
     to other.

  4. **Each Immediately the Other**:
     Inner and outer are determinations of reflection - inner as form of immanent reflection
     (essentiality), outer as form of immediacy reflected into other (unessentiality).
     But they constitute one identity. As determinations of form, they are simple form itself,
     but determined as opposite - unity is pure abstract determination in which one is
     immediately the other. Inner is immediately only outer - it is externality because it
     is inner. Outer is only inner because it is only outer. Something only inner is for
     that reason only outer. Something only outer is for that reason only inner. If inner
     is essence, outer is being - fact only in essence is only immediate being. Fact which
     only is is only in essence. Each presupposes other, passes over into it as truth, but
     in being truth of other, remains posited as determinateness, points to totality of both.

  5. **The Totality**:
     First identity: substrate indifferent to difference (as content). Second identity:
     unmediated identity of difference, immediate conversion (as pure form). Both are sides
     of one totality - totality is conversion of one identity into other. Totality as
     substrate/content is immediacy reflected into itself through presupposing reflection
     of form that sublates difference, posits itself as indifferent identity. Content is
     form itself determining itself as difference - one side as externality, other as
     immediacy reflected into itself (inner). Differences of form (inner/outer) are each
     posited as totality within it of itself and its other. Inner is immediacy, being,
     externality. Outer is only external - posited as unessential, returned into ground,
     therefore as inner. Transition is immediate identity (substrate) but also mediated
     identity - each is totality precisely through its other. Determinateness of either
     side is mediated through determinateness of other because each is in itself totality.
     Totality mediates itself with itself through form, determinateness mediates itself
     with itself through simple identity.

  6. **Essence is Self-Revealing**:
     What something is, that it is entirely in its externality. Externality is its totality
     and equally its unity reflected into itself. Appearance is not only reflection-into-other
     but immanent reflection. Externality is expression of what it is in itself. Content and
     form are absolutely identical. It is, in and for itself, nothing but this: to express
     itself. It is revealing of its essence. Essence consists simply in being self-revealing.
     This is the profound truth: essence is not hidden behind appearance - essence IS its
     appearance, its self-revelation.

  7. **Transition to Actuality**:
     Essential relation, in this identity of appearance with inner/essence, has determined
     itself as actuality. This completes Essential Relation and transitions to Actuality -
     the final moment of Essence before Concept. Actuality is essence that has revealed itself,
     that is what it appears to be - the unity of inner and outer, essence and appearance.

  8. **Connection to Form Processor**:
     Inner-Outer completes Aspect (in Form Processor) - the union of Entity (Realism) and
     Property (Idealism). Inner maps to Form/Shape, Outer maps to Matter/Property. The
     complete Essential Relation (Whole-Parts, Force-Expression, Inner-Outer) maps to Aspect
     as the self-revealing totality - essence expressing itself.

    text: `C. RELATION OF OUTER AND INNER

1. The relation of whole and parts is the immediate relation;
in it, therefore, reflected and existent immediacy have
a self-subsistence of their own.
But now, since they stand in essential relation,
their self-subsistence is their negative unity,
and this is now posited in the expression of force;
the reflected unity is essentially a becoming-other,
the unity's translation of itself into externality;
but this externality is just as immediately
taken back into that unity;
the difference of the self-subsisting forces sublates itself;
the expression of force is only a mediation
of the reflected unity with itself.
What is present is only an empty
and transparent difference, a reflective shine,
but this shine is the mediation
which is precisely the independent subsistence.
What we have is not just opposite determinations
openly sublating themselves,
and their movement is not only a transition;
rather, what we have is both that
the immediacy from which the start
and the transition into otherness
were made is itself only posited,
and that, consequently, each of the determinations is
already in its immediacy the unity with its other,
so that the transition equally is
a self-positing turning back into itself.

The inner is determined as
the form of reflected immediacy
or of essence over against
the outer as the form of being;
the two, however, are only one identity.
This identity is, first,
the sustaining unity of the two
as substrate replete of content,
or the absolute fact with respect to which
the two determinations are indifferent, external moments.
To this extent, it is content and totality,
a totality which is an inner
that has equally become an outer
but, in this outer, is not something-that-has-become
or something-that-has-been-left-behind but is self-equal.
The outer, in this determination, is not only
equal to the inner according to content
but the two are rather only one fact.
But this fact, as simple identity with itself,
is different from its form determinations,
or these determinations are external to it;
it is itself, therefore, an inner
which is different from its externality.
But this externality consists in the two determinations,
the inner and the outer, both constituting it.
But the fact is itself nothing other
than the unity of the two.
Again, therefore, the two sides are
the same according to content.
But in the fact they are as self-penetrating identity,
as substrate full of content.
But in the externality, as forms of the fact,
they are indifferent to that identity
and consequently each is indifferent to the other.`,
    summary:
      'Force expression: Empty transparent difference, reflective shine - mediation which is independent subsistence. Not just transition - immediacy is posited, each determination is already unity with other. Transition is self-positing turning back. Inner is form of reflected immediacy/essence, outer is form of being - one identity. Identity is sustaining unity as substrate replete of content - absolute fact. Two determinations are indifferent moments. It is content and totality - inner become outer but self-equal. Outer equals inner according to content - one fact. Fact is different from form determinations - itself inner different from externality. But externality consists in two determinations - fact is unity. Two sides same according to content - self-penetrating identity in fact, indifferent as forms.'

    text: `2. They are in this wise the different form determinations
that have an identical substrate, not in them but in an other.
These are determinations of reflection
which are each for itself:
the inner, as the form of immanent reflection,
the form of essentiality;
the outer, as the form instead of
immediacy reflected into an other,
or the form of unessentiality.
But the nature of relation has shown that
these determinations constitute just one identity alone.
In its expression force is a determining
which is one and the same as presupposing
and as returning into itself.
Inasmuch as the inner and the outer are
considered as determinations of form,
they are, therefore,
first, only the simple form itself,
and, second, because in this form they are
at the same time determined as opposite,
their unity is the pure abstract determination
in which the one is immediately the other,
and is this other because it is the one that it is.
Thus the inner is immediately only the outer,
and it is this determinateness of externality
for the reason that it is the inner;
conversely, the outer is only an inner
because it is only an outer.
In other words, since the unity of form
holds its two determinations as opposites,
their identity is only this transition,
and is in this transition only the other of both,
not their identity replete with content.
Or this holding fast to form is in general
the side of determinateness.
What is determined according to this side is
not the real totality of the whole
but the totality or the fact itself
only in the determinacy of form;
since this unity is simply the coincidence
of two opposed determinations,
then when one of them is taken first
(it is indifferent which),
it must be said of the substrate or the fact
that it is for this reason just as essentially
in the other determinateness,
but also only in the other,
just as it was first said
that it is only in the first.

Thus something which is at first only an inner,
is for just that reason only an outer.
Or conversely something which is only an outer,
is for that reason only an inner.
Or if the inner is determined as essence
but the outer as being,
then inasmuch as a fact is only in its essence,
it is for that very reason only an immediate being;
or a fact which only is, is for that very reason
as yet only in its essence.
Outer and inner are determinateness
so posited that each, as a determination,
not only presupposes the other
and passes over into it as its truth,
but, in being this truth of the other,
remains posited as determinateness
and points to the totality of both.
The inner is thus the completion
of essence according to form.
For in being determined as inner,
essence implies that it is deficient
and that it is only with reference to
its other, the outer;
but this other is not just being,
or even concrete existence,
but is the reference to essence or the inner.
What we have here is not just
the reference of the two to each other,
but the determining element of absolute form,
namely that each term is immediately its opposite,
and each is their common reference
to a third or rather to their unity.
Their mediation, however, still misses
this identical substrate that contains them both;
their reference is for this reason
the immediate conversion of the one into the other,
and this negative unity tying them together is
the simple point empty of content.`,
    summary:
      'Each immediately other: Different form determinations with identical substrate. Inner is form of immanent reflection (essentiality), outer is form of immediacy reflected into other (unessentiality). But they constitute one identity. As determinations of form, they are simple form itself, but determined as opposite - unity is pure abstract determination where one is immediately other. Inner is immediately only outer - it is externality because it is inner. Outer is only inner because it is only outer. Something only inner is only outer. Something only outer is only inner. If inner is essence, outer is being - fact only in essence is only immediate being. Each presupposes other, passes over as truth, but remains posited, points to totality. Inner is completion of essence according to form - essence is deficient, only with reference to outer. But outer is reference to essence/inner. Each term is immediately its opposite - common reference to unity. Mediation misses identical substrate - immediate conversion, negative unity is simple point empty of content.'

    title: 'Totality: each is totality through its other',
    text: `3. The first of the identities considered,
the identity of inner and outer,
is the substrate which is indifferent
to the difference of these determinations
as to a form external to it,
or the identity is as content.
The second is the unmediated identity of their difference,
the immediate conversion of each into its opposite,
or it is inner and outer as pure form.
But both these identities are only
the sides of one totality,
or the totality itself is only the
conversion of the one identity into the other.
The totality, as substrate and content,
is this immediacy reflected into itself
only through the presupposing reflection
of form that sublates their difference
and posits itself as indifferent identity,
as reflected unity over against it.
Or again, the content is the form itself
in so far as the latter determines itself as difference
and makes itself into one side of this difference as externality,
but into the other side as an immediacy
which is reflected into itself,
or into an inner.

It follows that, conversely,
the differences of form,
the inner and the outer,
are each posited as the totality
within it of itself and its other;
the inner, as simple identity
reflected into itself, is immediacy
and hence, no less than essence,
being and externality;
and the external,
as the manifold and determined being,
is only external,
that is, is posited as unessential
and as having returned into its ground,
therefore as inner.
This transition of each into the other is
their immediate identity, as substrate,
but also their mediated identity, that is,
each is what it is in itself,
the totality of the relation,
precisely through its other.
Or, conversely, the determinateness of
either side is mediated through
the determinateness of the other
because each is in itself the totality;
the totality thus mediates itself with itself
through the form or the determinateness,
and the determinateness mediates
itself with itself through its simple identity.`,
    summary:
      'Totality: First identity is substrate indifferent to difference (as content). Second is unmediated identity of difference, immediate conversion (as pure form). Both are sides of one totality - totality is conversion of one identity into other. Totality as substrate/content is immediacy reflected into itself through presupposing reflection of form that sublates difference, posits as indifferent identity. Content is form itself determining as difference - one side as externality, other as immediacy reflected into itself (inner). Differences of form (inner/outer) are each posited as totality within it of itself and its other. Inner is immediacy, being, externality. Outer is only external - unessential, returned into ground, therefore inner. Transition is immediate identity (substrate) but also mediated - each is totality precisely through its other. Determinateness of either side is mediated through other because each is in itself totality. Totality mediates itself through form, determinateness mediates itself through simple identity.'
