  Thing and its Properties — A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES

  This module translates the Thing section:
  - Concrete existence: essence coming forth into immediacy
  - Thing-in-itself and external concrete existence
  - Property: negativity of reflection, reference to itself as to an other
  - Reciprocal action of things: property as connecting reference
  - Transition to matter: thinghood passes over into property

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Concrete Existence as Essence's Self-Emptying**:
     Concrete existence is not a predicate but essence's absolute self-emptying.
     Essence has passed over into concrete existence - essence is concrete existence,
     not distinct from it. Concrete existence is reflection of ground into itself,
     self-identity attained in negation - mediation that has posited itself as
     identical with itself and through that is immediacy.

  2. **Thing-in-Itself and External Concrete Existence**:
     The thing-in-itself is essential immediate (sublated mediation). External
     concrete existence is unessential, positedness. But thing-in-itself is
     self-repelling - relates itself to itself as to an other. External reflection
     collapses into thing-in-itself. The determinateness of thing-in-itself is
     property.

  3. **Property as Reflected Quality**:
     Property is negativity of reflection (sublated mediation). But this is itself
     essentially mediation and reference - reference to itself as to an other.
     Property is ground that has passed over into externality and is truly reflected
     into itself. Thing-in-itself exists essentially in its properties.

  4. **Reciprocal Action and Transition to Matter**:
     Property is the reciprocal connecting reference - apart from which thing is
     nothing. Thinghood is reduced to indeterminate self-identity having essentiality
     only in property. Without properties, thing is only unessential compass.
     Thinghood passes over into property - property becomes self-subsisting matter.

  5. **Connection to Form Processor**:
     Thing maps to Entity - the self-subsistent existent. Property maps to Property
     (in Form Processor) - the self-subsisting matter/connection. This establishes
     the foundation for the Thing-Property structure in Appearance.

Concrete existence

Just as the principle of sufficient reason says
that whatever is has a ground,
or is something posited,
something mediated,
so there would also have to be
a principle of concrete existence saying
that whatever is, exists concretely.
The truth of being is to be,
not an immediate something,
but essence that has
come forth into immediacy.

But when it was further said
that whatever exists concretely
has a ground and is conditioned,
it also would have had to be said
that it has no ground and is unconditioned.
For concrete existence is the immediacy
that has come forth from the sublating
of the mediation that results
from the connection of ground and condition,
and which, in coming forth,
sublates this very coming forth.`,
    summary:
      'Concrete existence: Truth of being is essence coming forth into immediacy. Whatever exists concretely has ground/is conditioned, but also has no ground/is unconditioned. Concrete existence is immediacy from sublating mediation (ground-condition connection), and sublates this coming forth.'

    title: 'Proofs of God\'s existence: mediation and ground',
    text: `Inasmuch as mention may be made here of
the proofs of the concrete existence of God,
it is first to be noted that besides
immediate being that comes first,
and concrete existence
(or the being that proceeds from essence)
that comes second, there is still a third being,
one that proceeds from the concept,
and this is objectivity.
Proof is, in general, mediated cognition.
The various kinds of being require or contain
each its own kind of mediation,
and so will the nature of the proof also vary accordingly.
The ontological proof wants to start from the concept;
it lays down as its basis the sum total of all realities,
where under reality also concrete existence is subsumed.
Its mediation, therefore, is that of the syllogism,
and syllogism is not yet under consideration here.
We have already commented above (Part 1, Section 1)
on Kant's objection to the ontological proof,
and have remarked that by concrete existence
Kant understands the determinate immediate existence
with which something enters into the context of total experience,
that is, into the determination of being an other
and of being in reference to an other.
As an existent concrete in this way,
something is thus mediated by an other,
and concrete existence is in general the side of its mediation.
But in what Kant calls the concept, namely,
something taken as only simply self-referring,
or in representation as such, this mediation is missing;
in abstract self-identity, opposition is left out.
Now the ontological proof would have
to demonstrate that the absolute concept,
namely the concept of God,
attains to a determinate existence, to mediation,
or to demonstrate how simple essence
mediates itself with mediation.
This is done by the just mentioned
subsumption of concrete existence
under its universal, namely reality,
which is assumed as the middle term
between God in his concept, on the one hand,
and concrete existence, on the other.
This mediation, inasmuch as it has the form of a syllogism,
is not at issue here, as already said.
However, how that mediation of
essence and concrete existence truly comes about,
this is contained in the preceding exposition.
The nature of the proof itself will be considered
in the doctrine of cognition.
Here we have only to indicate what pertains
to the nature of mediation in general.`,
    summary:
      'Proofs of God: Three kinds of being - immediate, concrete existence (from essence), objectivity (from concept). Proof is mediated cognition. Ontological proof subsumes concrete existence under reality. True mediation of essence and concrete existence is in preceding exposition. Ground from contingency - accidental is groundless/self-sublating. Ground sublates itself - vanished mediation is ground (abyss).'

  {
    id: 'concrete-existence-ground-abyss',
    title: 'Ground as abyss: vanished mediation',
    text: `The proofs of the existence of God
adduce a ground for this existence.
It is not supposed to be
an objective ground of the existence of God,
for this existence is in and for itself.
It is, therefore, solely a ground for cognition.
It thereby presents itself as a ground
that vanishes in the subject matter
that at first seems to be grounded by it.
Now the ground which is derived
from the contingency of the world
entails the regress of the latter
into the absolute essence,
for the accidental is that which is
in itself groundless and self-sublating.
In this way, therefore,
the absolute essence does indeed proceed
from that which has no ground,
for the ground sublates itself
and with this there also vanishes
the reflective shine of the relation
that was given to God,
that it is grounded in an other.
This mediation is therefore true mediation.
But the reflection involved
in that proof does not know
the nature of the mediation that it performs.
On the one hand, it takes itself
to be something merely subjective,
and it consequently distances
its mediation from God himself;
on the other hand, for that same reason
it also fails to recognize its mediating movement,
that this movement is in the essence itself
and how it is there.
The true relation of reflection consists
in being both in one:
mediation as such but, of course, at the same time
a subjective, external mediation,
that is to say, a self-external mediation
which in turn internally sublates itself.
In that other presentation, however,
concrete existence is given the false relation
of appearing only as mediated or posited.

So, on the other side, concrete existence also
cannot be regarded merely as an immediate.
Taken in the determination of an immediacy,
the comprehension of God's concrete existence
has been declared to be beyond proof
and the knowledge of it
an immediate consciousness only, a faith.
Knowledge should arrive at
the conclusion that it knows nothing,
and this means that it gives up its mediating movement
and the determinations themselves
that have come up in the course of it.
This is what has also occurred in the foregoing;
but it must be added that reflection,
by ending up with the sublation of itself,
does not thereby have nothing for result,
so that the positive knowledge of the essence
would then be an immediate reference to it,
divorced from that result and self-originating,
an act that starts only from itself;
on the contrary, the end itself,
the foundering of the mediation,
is at the same time the ground
from which the immediate proceeds.
In "zu Grunde gehen," the German language unites,
as we remarked above,
the meaning of foundering and of ground;
the essence of God is said to be the
abyss (Abgrund in German) for finite reason.
This it is, indeed, in so far as
reason surrenders its finitude therein,
and sinks its mediating movement;
but this abyss, the negative ground,
is at the same time the positive ground
of the emergence of the existent,
of the essence immediate in itself;
mediation is an essential moment.
Mediation through ground sublates itself
but does not leave the ground standing under it,
so that what proceeds from it would be a posited
that has its essence elsewhere;
on the contrary, this ground is,
as an abyss, the vanished mediation,
and, conversely,
only the vanished mediation is
at the same time the ground
and, only through this negation,
the self-equal and immediate.`,
    summary:
      'Ground as abyss: Ground sublates itself - vanished mediation is ground. Foundering (zu Grunde gehen) unites foundering and ground. Abyss (Abgrund) is negative ground but also positive ground of emergence. Vanished mediation is ground - only through negation, self-equal and immediate.'

    text: `Concrete existence, then, is not to be taken here
as a predicate, or as a determination of essence,
of which it could be said in a proposition,
"essence exists concretely," or "it has concrete existence."
On the contrary, essence has passed over into concrete existence;
concrete existence is the absolute self-emptying of essence,
an emptying that leaves nothing of the essence behind.
The proposition should therefore run:
"Essence is concrete existence;
it is not distinct from its concrete existence."
Essence has passed over into concrete existence
inasmuch as essence as ground
no longer distinguishes itself from itself as grounded,
or inasmuch as the ground has sublated itself.
But this negation is no less essentially its position,
or the simply positive continuity with itself;
concrete existence is
the reflection of the ground into itself,
its self-identity as attained in its negation,
therefore the mediation that has posited itself
as identical with itself and through that is immediacy.

Now because concrete existence is
essentially self-identical mediation,
it has the determinations of mediation in it,
but in such a way that the determinations are
at the same time reflected into themselves
and have essential and immediate subsistence.
As an immediacy which is posited through sublation,
concrete existence is negative unity and being-within-itself;
it therefore immediately determines itself
as a concrete existent and as thing.`,

    text: `A. THE THING AND ITS PROPERTIES

Concrete existence as a concrete existent is posited in
the form of the negative unity which it essentially is.
But this negative unity is at first only immediate determination,
hence the oneness of the something in general.
But the concretely existent something is different
from the something that exists immediately.
The former is essentially an immediacy that has arisen
through the reflection of mediation into itself.
The concretely existent something is thus a thing.

The thing is distinct from its concrete existence
just as the something can be distinguished from its being.
The thing and the concrete existent
are immediately one and the same.
But because concrete existence is not
the first immediacy of being
but has the moment of mediation within it,
its further determination as thing
and the distinguishing of the two is
not a transition but truly an analysis.
Concrete existence as such contains
this very distinction in the moment of its mediation:
the distinction of thing-in-itself
and external concrete existence.`,

    title: 'Thing-in-itself: essential immediate',
    text: `a. The thing in itself and concrete existence

1. The thing in itself is the concrete existent
as the essential immediate that has resulted
from the sublated mediation.
Mediation is therefore equally essential to it;
but this distinction in this first
or immediate concrete existence
falls apart into indifferent determinations.
The one side, namely the mediation of the thing,
is its non-reflected immediacy,
and hence its being in general;
and this being, since it is
at the same time determined as mediation,
is an existence which is other to itself,
manifold and external within itself.
But it is not just immediate existence;
it also refers to the sublated mediation
and the essential immediacy;
it is therefore immediate existence
as unessential, as positedness.
(When the thing is differentiated
from its concrete existence,
it is then the possible,
the thing of representation,
or the thing of thought,
which as such is at the same time
not supposed to exist.
However, the determination of possibility
and of the opposition of the thing
and its concrete existence comes later.)
But the thing-in-itself and its mediated being are
both contained in the concrete existence,
and both are themselves concrete existences;
the thing-in-itself exists concretely
and is the essential concrete existence,
but the mediated being is
the thing's unessential concrete existence.

The thing in itself, as the simple reflectedness
of the concrete existence within itself,
is not the ground of unessential existence;
it is the unmoved, indeterminate unity,
for it has precisely the determination of
being the sublated mediation,
and is therefore the substrate of that existence.
For this reason reflection, too,
as an immediate existence
which is mediated through some other,
falls outside the thing-in-itself.
The latter is not supposed to have
any determinate manifold in it;
for this reason it obtains it only
when exposed to external reflection,
though it remains indifferent to it.
(The thing-in-itself has color
only when exposed to the eye,
smell when exposed to the nose, and so on.)
Its diversity consists of aspects
which an other picks out,
specific points of reference
which this other assumes
with respect to the thing-in-itself
and which are not the thing's own determinations.`,
    summary:
      'Thing-in-itself: Essential immediate (sublated mediation). Mediation equally essential but falls apart into indifferent determinations. Mediated being is unessential concrete existence (positedness). Thing-in-itself is unmoved, indeterminate unity - substrate. No determinate manifold - obtains only from external reflection (color from eye, smell from nose). Diversity consists of aspects other picks out.'

    id: 'thing-in-itself-2',
    title: 'External reflection: reflective shine',
    text: `2. Now this other is reflection
which, determined as external, is,
first, external to itself and determinate manifoldness.
Second, it is external to the essential concrete existent
and refers to it as to its absolute presupposition.
These two moments of external reflection,
its own manifoldness and its reference to
the thing-in-itself as its other,
are however one and the same.
For this concrete existence is
external only in so far as it refers to
the essential identity as to an other.
The manifoldness, therefore, does not have
an independent  subsistence of its own
besides the thing-in-itself
but, over against it,
it is rather only as reflective shine;
in its necessary reference to it,
it is like a reflex refracting itself in it.
Diversity, therefore, is present as the reference
of an other to the thing-in-itself;
but this other is nothing that subsists on its own
but is only as reference to the thing-in-itself;
but at the same time it only is in being repelled from it;
thus it is the unsupported rebound of itself within itself.

Now since the thing-in-itself is
the essential identity of the concrete existence,
this essenceless reflection does not accrue to it
but collapses within itself externally to it.
It founders to the ground
and thus itself comes to be essential identity
or thing-in-itself.
This can also be looked at in this way:
the essenceless concrete existence has
in the thing-in-itself its reflection into itself;
it refers to it in the first place as to its other;
but as the other over against that which is in itself,
it is only the sublation of its self,
and its coming to be in the in-itself.
The thing-in-itself is thus identical
with external concrete existence.`,

      'External reflection: External to itself and to essential concrete existent. Manifoldness and reference to thing-in-itself are one and same.

The thing-in-itself is self-referring
essential concrete existence;
it is self-identity only in so far as
it holds negativity's reflection in itself;
that which appeared as concrete existence
external to it is, consequently, a moment in it.
It is for this reason also self-repelling thing-in-itself
which thus relates itself to itself as to an other.
Hence, there are now a plurality of things-in-themselves
standing in the reciprocal reference of external reflection.
This unessential concrete existence is
their reciprocal relation as others;
but it is, further, also essential to them
or, in other words, this unessential concrete existence,
in collapsing internally, is thing-in-itself,
but a thing-in-itself which is other than the first,
for that first is immediate essentiality
whereas the present proceeds from
the unessential concrete existence.
But this other thing-in-itself is only an other in general;
for, as self-identical thing, it has no
further determinateness vis-à-vis the first;
like the first, it is the reflection within itself
of the unessential concrete existence.
The determinateness of the various things-in-themselves
over against one another falls therefore into external reflection.

3. This external reflection is henceforth a relating of
the things-in-themselves to one another,
their reciprocal mediation as others.
The things-in-themselves are thus
the extreme terms of a syllogism,
the middle term of which is made up
by their external concrete existence,
the concrete existence by virtue of which
they are other to each other and distinct.
This, their difference, falls only
in their connecting reference;
they send determinations, as it were,
from their surface into the reference,
while remaining themselves indifferent to it.
This relation now constitutes
the totality of the concrete existence.
The thing-in-itself is drawn into
a reflection external to it
in which it has a manifold of determinations;
this is the repelling of itself from itself
into another thing-in-itself,
a repelling which is its rebounding back into itself,
for each thing-in-itself is an other
only as reflected back from the other;
it has its supposition not in itself but in the other,
is determined only through the determinateness of the other;
this other is equally determined only
through the determinateness of the first.
But the two things-in-themselves,
since each has its difference
not in it but in the other,
are not therefore distinct things;
the thing-in-itself, in relating as it should to
the other extreme as to another thing-in-itself,
relates to it as to something non-distinguished from it,
and the external reflection that should constitute
the mediating reference between the extremes is a
relation of the thing-in-itself only to itself,
or is essentially its reflection within itself;
the reflection is, therefore,
determinateness existing in itself,
or the determinateness of the thing-in-itself.

This determinateness of the thing-in-itself is
the property of the thing.`,

The thing-in-itself exists in concreto by essence;
external immediacy and determinateness
belong to its being-in-itself,
or to its immanent reflection.
The thing in-itself is thus a thing that has properties,
and hence there are a number of things distinct from one another,
not because of some viewpoint alien to them but through themselves.
These many diverse things stand in essential reciprocal action
by virtue of their properties;
the property is this reciprocal connecting reference itself,
apart from which the thing is nothing;
the reciprocal determination,
the middle term of the things-in-themselves
that are taken as extreme terms
indifferent to the reference connecting them,
is itself the self-identical reflection
and the thing-in-itself
which those extremes were supposed to be.
Thinghood is thus reduced to the
form of indeterminate self-identity
having its essentiality only in its property.
Thus, if one speaks of a thing
or of things in general without a determinate property,
then their difference is merely indifferent, quantitative.
What is considered as a thing can just as well be made into
a plurality of things or be considered as a plurality of things;
their separation or their union is an external one.
A book is a thing, and each of its pages is also a thing,
and equally so every tiny piece of its pages,
and so on to infinity.
The determinateness, in virtue of which
a thing is this thing only,
lies solely in its properties.
It is through them that the thing
differentiates itself from other things,
for the property is the negative reflection
and the differentiating;
only in its property, therefore, does the thing possess
in it the difference of itself from others.
This is the difference reflected into itself,
by virtue of which the thing, in its positedness,
that is, in its reference to others,
is equally indifferent to the other
and to its reference to it.
Without its properties, therefore,
there is nothing that remains to the thing

The latter is in the thing,
therefore, not as something sublated,
not just a moment of it;
on the contrary, the truth of the thing is
that it is only an unessential compass
which is indeed a negative unity,
but only like the one of the something,
that is to say, a one which is immediate.
Whereas earlier the thing was determined as
an unessential compass because it was made such
by an external abstraction that omits the property,
this abstraction now happens through the transition of
the thing-in-itself into the property itself.
But there is now an inversion of values,
for the earlier abstraction still envisaged
the abstract thing without its property
as being the essential,
and the property as an external determination,
whereas it is the thing as such which is now reduced,
through itself, to the determination of
an indifferent external form of the property.
The latter is henceforth thus freed of
the indeterminate and impotent bond
which is the unity of the thing;
the property is what constitutes
the subsistence of the thing;
it is a self-subsisting matter.
Since this matter is simple continuity with itself,
it only possesses at first the form of diversity.
There is, therefore, a manifold of
these self-subsisting matters,
and the thing consists of them.`,
    summary:
      'Transition to matter: Property connects extremes but is itself self-subsistent. Things are unessential - essential only as property (self-differentiating reflection). Thing is unessential compass (negative unity like something). Inversion: thing reduced to indifferent external form of property. Property freed - constitutes subsistence of thing. Property is self-subsisting matter. Manifold of self-subsisting matters - thing consists of them.'
