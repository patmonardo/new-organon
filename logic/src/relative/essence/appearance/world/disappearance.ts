  Dissolution of Appearance — C. THE DISSOLUTION OF APPEARANCE

  This module translates the Disappearance section:
  - Two worlds as opposites: what is positive in one is negative in the other
  - Difference disappears: each world is the other
  - World of appearance is law equal to itself
  - World-in-itself becomes self-opposed, essenceless
  - Each is totality containing moment of the other
  - Law realized: inner identity existent, content raised to ideality
  - Law becomes essential relation
  - World foundered: still totality but as essential relation

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Two Worlds as Opposites**:
     World-in-itself is determinate ground of world of appearance - negative moment,
     totality of content determinations. But constitutes completely opposed side.
     What is positive in world of appearance is negative in world-in-itself, and vice-versa
     (north/south pole, positive/negative electricity, evil/goodness).

  2. **Difference Disappears**:
     In this opposition, their difference has disappeared. World-in-itself is itself
     world of appearance, and world of appearance is world essential within. Each is
     the other.

  3. **World of Appearance as Law**:
     World of appearance determined as reflection into otherness - determinations have
     ground in other. But other is likewise reflected into other - other sublates itself
     as other. Two refer to themselves - world of appearance is within it law equal
     to itself.

  4. **World-in-Itself as Self-Opposed**:
     World-in-itself is self-identical content, exempt from otherness. But as complete
     reflection of world of appearance into itself, contains negativity as moment,
     self-reference as reference to otherness. Becomes self-opposed, self-inverting,
     essenceless content. Retains form of immediate concrete existence - sublated ground.

  5. **Each is Totality**:
     Each world is totality of self-identical reflection and reflection-into-other
     (being-in-and-for-itself). One supposed to be reflected concrete existence, other
     immediate. But each continues into other - identity of these two moments. Totality
     splits into two totalities. Each essentially contains moment of other. Self-subsistence
     is reference to other, has self-subsistence in unity of the two.

  6. **Law Realized**:
     Law started as identity of content and another content - positedness of one is
     positedness of other. Difference: identity only internal, not yet in sides. Content
     indifferent, diversified. But now law is realized - inner identity is existent,
     content raised to ideality. Each side has other in it - truly identical with it
     and with itself.

  7. **Law Becomes Essential Relation**:
     Law is essential relation. Truth of unessential world is world in and for itself
     and other to it. But this world is totality - itself and first world. Both are
     immediate concrete existences, reflections in otherness, truly reflected into themselves.
     World foundered both as essential world and world of appearance - still totality but
     as essential relation. Essential relation is consummation of unity of form.

  8. **Dialectical Completion**:
     This completes the World section. The two worlds disappear into each other, revealing
     their essential unity in relation. This prepares for Relation (Essential Relation)
     where whole-parts, force-expression, and outer-inner are developed.

  9. **Connection to Form Processor**:
     Essential Relation maps to Aspect (in Form Processor) - the consummation of unity
     of form, where Entity (Thing) and Property (World/Law) unite in their essential
     connection.

    text: `C. THE DISSOLUTION OF APPEARANCE

The world that exists in and for itself is
the determinate ground of the world of appearance
and is this only in so far as, within it,
it is the negative moment
and hence the totality of the content determinations
and their alterations that correspond to that world of appearance,
yet constitutes at the same time its completely opposed side.
The two worlds thus relate to each other in such a way
that what in the world of appearance is positive,
in the world existing in and for itself is negative,
and, conversely, what is negative in the former
is positive in the latter.
The north pole in the world of appearance
is the south pole in and for itself, and vice-versa;
positive electricity is in itself negative, and so forth.
What is evil in the world of appearance is
in and for itself goodness and a piece of good luck.`,
    summary:
      'Two worlds as opposites: World-in-itself is determinate ground (negative moment, totality of content). But constitutes completely opposed side. What is positive in world of appearance is negative in world-in-itself, and vice-versa (north/south pole, positive/negative electricity, evil/goodness).'

    text: `In fact it is precisely in this opposition
of the two worlds that their difference has disappeared,
and what was supposed to be
the world existing in and for itself is
itself the world of appearance
and this last, conversely,
the world essential within.
The world of appearance is in the first instance
determined as reflection into otherness,
so that its determinations and concrete existences have
their ground and subsistence in an other;
but because this other, as other,
is likewise reflected into an other,
the other to which they both refer is
one which sublates itself as other;
the two consequently refer to themselves;
the world of appearance is within it,
therefore, law equal to itself.
Conversely, the world existing in and for itself is
in the first instance self-identical content,
exempt from otherness and change;
but this content, as complete reflection of
the world of appearance into itself,
or because its diversity is difference
reflected into itself and absolute,
consequently contains negativity as a moment
and self-reference as reference to otherness;
it thereby becomes self-opposed, self-inverting, essenceless content.
Further, this content of the world existing in and for itself has
thereby also retained the form of immediate concrete existence.
For it is at first the ground of the world of appearance;
but since it has opposition in it, it is equally
sublated ground and immediate concrete existence.`,
    summary:
      'Difference disappears: In opposition, difference disappears. World-in-itself is world of appearance, and world of appearance is world essential within. World of appearance: other sublates itself as other - refers to themselves, is law equal to itself. World-in-itself: self-identical content but as complete reflection contains negativity, becomes self-opposed, essenceless. Retains form of immediate concrete existence - sublated ground.'

each, each within it, the totality of
self-identical reflection and of reflection-into-other,

They are both the self-subsisting wholes of concrete existence;
the one is supposed to be only reflected concrete existence,
the other immediate concrete existence;
but each continues into the other and, within, is
therefore the identity of these two moments.
What we have, therefore, is this totality
that splits into two totalities,
the one reflected totality and the other immediate totality.
Both, in the first instance, are self-subsistent;
but they are this only as totalities,
and this they are inasmuch as each essentially contains
the moment of the other in it.
Hence the distinct self-subsistence of each,
one determined as immediate and one as reflected,
is now so posited as to be essentially the reference to the other
and to have its self-subsistence in this unity of the two.`,

      'Each is totality: Each world is totality of self-identical reflection and reflection-into-other (being-in-and-for-itself). One supposed to be reflected concrete existence, other immediate.

at first only an internal identity

Consequently the identity is, for its part, not realized;
the content of law is not identical
but indifferent, diversified.
This content, therefore, is on its side only in itself
so determined that the positedness of the one is
the positedness of the other;
this determination is not yet present in it.
But now law is realized;
its inner identity is existent at the same time
