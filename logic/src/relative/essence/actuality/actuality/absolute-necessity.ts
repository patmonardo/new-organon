determinate necessity is therefore immediate actual necessity.

Consequently, it is at the same time
immediately determined as possibility,
as mediated by virtue of its negation.
But accordingly, this possibility is
immediately nothing but this mediating

both in the same manner, are positedness.
Thus it is necessity which is
equally the sublating of this positedness,

it is the determining of it as positedness.
It is necessity itself, therefore,

has repelled itself from itself.`,
