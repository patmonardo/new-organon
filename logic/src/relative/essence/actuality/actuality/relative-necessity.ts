the immediately existent manifoldness of
circumstances that refer to it.

both possibility and actuality,

they therefore constitute the form,

is determined as against its possibility;
as this determinate and hence reflected actuality,
it is real possibility.
This real possibility is now indeed the posited whole of the form,

is not its own possibility but the in-itself of an other actual;

something formally identical according to its in-itself,
free of contradiction because of its simple content determination;
but, as self-identical, this something must also not contradict
itself according to its developed and differentiated circumstances
and all else connected with it.
But, secondly, because it is manifold in itself
and in manifold connection with others,
and variety inherently passes over into opposition,
it is contradictory.
Whenever a possibility is in question,
and the issue is to demonstrate its contradiction,
one need only fasten on to the multiplicity that it contains as content
or as its conditioned concrete existence,
and from this the contradiction will easily be discovered.
And this contradiction is not just a function of comparing;
on the contrary, the manifold of concrete existence is in itself this,
to sublate itself and to founder to the ground:
in this it explicitly has the determination of
being only a possibility.
Whenever all the conditions of a fact are completely present,
the fact is actually there;
the completeness of the conditions is
the totality as in the content,
and the fact is itself this content determined
as being equally actual as possible.
In the sphere of the conditioned ground,
the conditions have the form
(that is, the ground or the reflection that stands on its own)
outside them,
and it is this form that makes them moments
of the fact and elicits concrete existence in them.
Here, on the contrary, the immediate actuality is
not determined to be condition by virtue of
a presupposing reflection,
but the supposition is rather that the immediate actuality is
itself the possibility.`,

it is a twofold that is now sublated;
for this possibility is itself
the twofold of actuality and possibility.
(1) The actuality is formal, or is a concrete existence
which appeared to subsist immediately,
and through its sublating becomes reflected being,
the moment of an other,
and thus comes in possession of the in-itself.
(2) That concrete existence was also determined
as possibility or as the in-itself, but of an other.
As it sublates itself, this in-itself of the other is
also sublated and passes over into actuality.
This movement of self-sublating real possibility
thus produces the same moments that are already present,
but each as it comes to be out of the other;
in this negation, therefore, the possibility
is also not a transition but a self-rejoining.
In formal possibility, if something was possible,
then an other than it, not itself, was also possible.
Real possibility no longer has such an other over against it,
for it is real in so far as it is itself also actuality.
Therefore, as its immediate concrete existence,
the circle of conditions, sublates itself,
it makes itself into the in-itselfness which it already is,
namely the in-itself of an other.
And conversely, since its moment of in-itselfness
thereby sublates itself at the same time,
it becomes actuality, hence the moment
which it likewise already is.
What disappears is consequently this,
that actuality was determined as the possibility
or the in-itself of an other,
and, conversely, the possibility as an actuality
which is not that of which it is the possibility.`,

Formal possibility: other also possible. Real possibility: no other over against it (itself also actuality).

which is only positedness

as transition into the other as such;

the other moment of actuality within it,
is already itself necessity.
Hence what is really possible can no longer be otherwise;
under the given conditions and circumstances,
nothing else can follow.
Real possibility and necessity are, therefore,
only apparently distinguished;
theirs is an identity that does not first come to be

Real possibility is therefore a connection full of content,
for the content is that identity, existing in itself,
which is indifferent to form.`,

but this immediate being as determinateness is also the negative of
itself, is an in-itself or possibility and so real possibility.
As this unity of the two moments, it is the totality of form,
but a totality which is still external to itself;
it is the unity of possibility and actuality in such a way that
(1) the manifold concrete existence is possibility immediately or positively:
it is a possible, something self-identical as such, because it is an actual;
(2) inasmuch as this possibility of concrete existence is posited,
it is determined as only possibility,
as the immediate conversion of actuality into its opposite, or as contingency.
Hence this possibility which immediate actuality has within
in so far as it is condition, is only the in-itself
or the possibility of an other.
Because this in-itself, as shown, sublates itself and this positedness
is itself posited, real possibility becomes indeed necessity;

real possibility is the necessary only in itself,
