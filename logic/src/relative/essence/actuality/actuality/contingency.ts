But because the determination is here totality of form,
this in-itself is determined as sublated

as the negative of actuality, it is posited as negative.
Possibility entails, therefore, two moments.
It has first the positive moment
of being a being-reflected-into-itself.
But this being-reflected-into-itself,

no longer has the value of essence but has rather
the negative meaning that possibility is (in a second moment)
something deficient, that it points to an other, to actuality,

everything is possible

the realm of possibility is therefore
limitless manifoldness.
But every manifold is determined in itself

it possesses negation within.
Indifferent diversity passes over

it therefore has the second determination of being only a possible
and the ought-to-be of the totality of form.
Without this ought-to-be, possibility is essentiality as such;
but the absolute form entails this,
that essence itself is only a moment
and that it has no truth without being.
Possibility is this mere essentiality,
but so posited as to be only a moment,
to be disproportionate with respect to the absolute form.
It is the in-itself, determined as only a posited

that possibility as form determination

As possible, this content is an in-itself

But because this content is only a possible,
an other opposite to it is equally possible.
"A is A"; then, too, "not-A is not-A."
These two statements each express
the possibility of its content determination.
But, as identical statements,
they are indifferent to each other;
that the other is also added,
is not posited in either.
Possibility is the connection comparing the two;
as a reflection of the totality,
it implies that the opposite also is possible.
It is therefore the ground for drawing the connection that,
because A equals A, not-A also equals not-A;
entailed in the possible A there is also the possible not-A,
and it is this reference itself connecting them
which determines both as possible.

But this connection, in which
the one possible also contains its other,
is as such a contradiction that sublates itself.
Now, since it is determined to be reflective
and, as we have just seen, reflectively self-sublating,
it is also therefore an immediate

it is immediately in it as sublated, as only possibility.
Conversely, actuality which is in unity with possibility
is only sublated immediacy;
or again, because formal actuality is only immediate first actuality,
it is only a moment, only sublated actuality, or only possibility.

With this we also have a more precise expression of
the extent to which possibility is actuality.
Possibility is not yet all actuality;
there has been no talk yet of real and absolute actuality.
It is still only the possibility as it first presented itself,
namely the formal possibility that has determined itself
as being only possibility and hence the formless actuality
which is only being or concrete existence in general.
Everything possible has therefore in general
a being or a concrete existence.`,

This actuality is, therefore, mere being or concrete existence,

of a positedness or a possibility.
Conversely, possibility is immanent reflection
or the in-itself posited as positedness;
what is possible is an actual in this sense of actuality,
that it has only as much value as contingent actuality;
it is itself something contingent.

The contingent thus presents these two sides.
First, in so far as it has possibility immediately in it,
or, what is the same, in so far as
this possibility is sublated in it,
it is not positedness, nor is it mediated,
but is immediate actuality; it has no ground.
Because this immediate actuality pertains also to the possible,
the latter is determined no less than the actual as contingent
and is likewise groundless.

But, second, the contingent is the actual
as what is only possible, or as a positedness;
thus the possible also, as formal in-itself, is only positedness.
Consequently, the two are both not in and for themselves
but have their immanent reflection in an other,
or they do have a ground.

The contingent thus has no ground because it is contingent;
and for that same reason it has a ground, because it is contingent.`,

both have this determination in them

So actuality, in its immediate unity with possibility,
is only concrete existence and is determined as groundless,
something only posited or only possible;
or, as reflected and determined over against possibility,
it is separated from possibility,
from immanent reflectedness,
and then, too, is no less
immediately only a possible.
Likewise possibility, as simple in-itself,
is something immediate,
only an existent in general;
or, opposed to actuality,
it equally is an in-itself
without actuality, only a possible,
but, for that very reason,
again only a concrete,
not immanently reflected,
existence in general.

This absolute restlessness of the becoming of
these two determinations is contingency.

immediately turns into the opposite,
in this opposite each equally rejoins itself,
and this identity of the two,
of each in the other,
is necessity.`,

the possibility of the necessary is a sublated one.
The contingent is therefore necessary
because the actual is determined as a possible;
its immediacy is consequently sublated

this ground-grounded-connection,

What is necessary is,

At the same time it is in itself;
this immanent reflection is an other than that immediacy of being,

Thus the existent is not the necessary;
but this in-itself is itself only positedness;
it is sublated and itself immediate.
And so actuality, in that from which it is distinguished,
in possibility, is identical with itself.
As this identity, it is necessity.`,
