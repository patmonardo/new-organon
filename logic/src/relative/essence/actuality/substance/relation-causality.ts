Substance as power determines itself;

the sublation of the determining and a turning back.
It determines itself: substance, that which determines, is
thus the immediate and that which is itself already determined;
in determining itself it therefore posits
the already determined as determined;
and thus it has sublated the
positedness and has returned into itself.
Conversely, because this turning back is
the negative reference of substance to itself,
it is itself a determining

it is through this turning back that
the determinate comes to be from which
substance seems to begin

the power of substance in its truth
as the manifestation by which
that which is in itself,
the accident or the positedness,

what the accidentality of the relation
of substance is, namely substance as positedness;

is substantially such only by vanishing, only as transient;

the subject who is the agent,

    text: `The cause, say the painter or the propulsive body,
does have yet another content than,
in the case of the painter,
the colors and the form combining
these into a painting;
and, in the other case,
the movement of specific strength and direction.
But this further content is a contingent side-being
which has nothing to do with the cause;
whatever other qualities the painter
might possess besides being the painter of this painting,
this does not enter into the painting;
only those of his properties
which are displayed in the effect
are present in him as cause;
as for the rest, he is not a cause.
Likewise, whether the propulsive body is
of stone or wood, green, yellow, and so on,
all this does not enter into its propulsion
and, to this extent, is not a cause.

It is worth noting in regard to
this tautology of the relation of causality
that the tautology does not seem to occur
whenever it is not the proximate,
but the remote cause which is at issue.
The alteration of form
which the basic fact undergoes
as it passes through several middle terms
hides the identity which it preserves across them.
In this proliferation of causes
introduced between it and the last effect,
that fact is linked to other things
and circumstances,
so that it is not that first term,
which is declared the cause,
but all these several causes together,
that contain the complete effect.

For instance, if a man developed his talents
in circumstances due to the loss of his father
who was hit by a bullet in battle, then this shot
(or still further back,
the war or some cause of the war,
and on to infinity)
could be adduced as the cause of the man's skillfulness.
But it is clear that the shot, for one,
is not the cause by itself
but only in conjunction with the
other efficient determinations.
Or more precisely, the shot is not the cause at all,
but only a single moment that pertained to
the circumstances of the possibility.

But it is the inadmissible application of
the relation of causality to the relations of
physico-organic and spiritual life that must be noted above all.
Here that which is called the cause does indeed show itself
to be of a different content than the effect,
but this is because anything that has an effect on
a living thing is independently determined,
altered, and transmuted by the latter,
for the living thing will not let
the cause come to its effect,
that is, it sublates it as cause.
Thus it is inadmissible to say that
nourishment is the cause of blood,
or that such and such a dish, or chill and humidity,
are the causes of fever or of what have you;
it is equally inadmissible to give the Ionic climate
as the cause of Homer's works,
or Caesar's ambition as the cause of
the fall of Rome's republican constitution.
In history in general there are indeed
spiritual masses and individuals
at play and influencing each other;
but it is of the nature of spirit,
in a much higher sense than it is of
the character of living things,
that it will not admit another
originative principle within itself,
or that it will not let a cause
continue to work its causality in it undisturbed
but will rather interrupt and transmute it.
But these relations belong to the idea,
and will come up for discussion then.
This much can still be noted here,
namely that in so far as the relation of cause
and effect is admitted,
albeit in an inappropriate sense,
the effect cannot be greater than the cause.
It has become a common witticism in history
to let great effects arise from small causes
and to cite as the first cause of an event
of far-reaching and profound consequence an anecdote.
Any such so-called first cause is to be regarded
as no more than an occasion, an external stimulus,
of which the inner spirit of the event had no need,
or could have used a countless number of others,
in order to make its first appearance,
to give itself a first breath and announce itself.
The converse is rather the case.
It is by the spirit that any such
triviality and contingency is determined
in the first place to be the occasion of spirit.
Historical arabesques that draw a full-blown figure
out of a slender stalk are no doubt an ingenious,
but highly superficial, practice.
It is true that in the rise of the great out of the small
we witness everywhere the conversion
that spirit works on the external;
but precisely for this reason
the external is not the cause within spirit;
rather, that conversion itself sublates the relation of causality.`,
    summary: 'Cause has further content (contingent side-being) not entering into cause. Remote cause: alteration of form hides identity, several causes together contain complete effect. Shot not cause by itself, only moment of possibility. Inadmissible: causality to physico-organic/spiritual life. Living thing determines/alters/transmutes, sublates cause. Spirit does not admit originative principle, interrupts/transmutes. Effect cannot be greater than cause. Small causes/great effects = occasion/stimulus, spirit determines occasion. Conversion sublates causality.'

that content and form are different
and indifferent to each other,
extends further.
The determination of form is also content determination;
cause and effect, the two sides of the relation,
are therefore also another content.
Or the content, because it is only as the content of a form,
has the difference of this form within it
and is essentially different.
But this form of the content is the
relation of causality,
which is a content identical
in cause and the effect,
and consequently the different content is externally connected,
on the one hand with the cause
and on the other with the effect;
hence the content itself does not enter into
the effective action and into the relation.
This external content is therefore relationless,
an immediate concrete existence,
or because it is as content
the implicit identity of cause and effect,
it is also immediate, existent identity.
This content is, therefore, anything at all
which has manifold determinations of its existence,
among them also this, that it is
in some respect or other cause or also effect.
In it, the form determinations of cause and effect
have their substrate, that is to say,
their essential subsistence
and each has a particular subsistence
(since their identity is their subsistence);
but it is a subsistence which is at the same time immediate,
not their subsistence as unity of form or as relation.
But this thing is not only substrate but also substance,
for it is identical subsistence only as subsistence of the relation.
Moreover, the substance is finite substance,
for it is determined as immediate over against its causality.
But it has causality at the same time,
for it is just as much an identity as this relation.
Now this substrate is, as cause,
negative reference to itself.
But this "itself" to which it refers is,
first, a positedness because it is determined as immediately actual;
this positedness, as content, is any determination whatever.
Second, causality is external to the substrate
and itself constitutes, therefore, its positedness.
Now since it is causal substance,
its causality consists in negatively referring itself to itself,
hence to its positedness and external causality.
The effective action of this substance thus
begins from something external,
frees itself from this external determination,
and its turning back into itself is
the preservation of its immediate concrete existence
and the sublation of the one which is posited,
and consequently of its causality as such.`,

    text: `We now consider the second determinateness of causality
which concerns form;
this relation is causality external to itself,
as the originariness which is
within just as much positedness or effect.
This union of opposite determination
in an existent substrate constitutes
the infinite regress from cause to cause.
We start from an effect;
the latter has as effect a cause;
but this cause has a cause in turn, and so on.
Why does the cause have a cause in turn?
That is to say, why is the same side
which was previously determined as cause
now determined as effect
and therefore demands a new cause?

Because the cause is something finite,
a determinate in general;
determined as one moment of the form
as against the effect;
so it has its determinateness or negation outside it;
but for this very reason it is itself finite,
has its determinateness within it
and is thereby positedness or effect.
Its identity as this positedness is also posited,
but it is a third term, the immediate substrate;
causality is therefore external to itself,
because its originariness is here an immediacy.
The difference of form is therefore
a first determinateness,
not yet determinateness posited as determinateness;
it is existent otherness.
Finite reflection, on the one hand,
stops short at this immediate,
removes the unity of form from it
and makes it be cause in one respect
and effect in another;
on the other hand, it transfers
the unity of form into the infinite,
and through the endless progression
expresses its impotence in attaining
and holding fast to this unity.

Exactly the same is the case of the effect,
or rather the endless progression from effect to effect
is one and the same as  the regression from cause to cause.
Just as in the latter a cause becomes an effect
which has another cause in turn,
so too, conversely, the effect becomes a cause
which has another effect in turn.
The determinate cause under consideration
begins from an externality
and returns in its effect back to itself,
but not as cause;
on the contrary, it loses its causality in that process.
But, conversely, the effect arrives at
a substrate which is substance,
an original self-referring subsistence;
in it, therefore, that positedness becomes a positedness,
that is to say, this substance, as the effect is posited in it,
behaves as cause.
But that first effect, the positedness
that accrues to the substance externally,
is other than the second which the substance produces;
for this second effect is determined as
the immanent reflection of substance
whereas the first is in it as an externality.
But because causality is here causality external to itself,
it also equally fails to return in its effect back to itself
but becomes therein external to itself;
its effect becomes again a positedness in a substrate;
as in another substance which however
equally makes this positedness into positedness,
in other words, manifests itself as cause,
again repels its effect from itself,
and so on, into bad infinity.`,
    summary: 'Second determinateness: causality external to itself (originariness = positedness/effect). Union of opposite determination = infinite regress. Cause finite (determinate, one moment, determinateness/negation outside, finite within, positedness/effect). Identity as positedness = third term (immediate substrate), causality external (originariness = immediacy). Form difference = first determinateness (existent otherness). Finite reflection: stops at immediate (cause/effect in different respects), transfers unity into infinite (endless progression, impotence). Same for effect: endless progression = regression. Cause begins external, returns but loses causality. Effect arrives at substance (original self-referring), positedness becomes positedness, substance behaves as cause.

    text: `This cause now acts,
for it is the negative power over itself;
at the same time it is its own presupposition;
thus it acts upon itself as upon an other,
upon the passive substance.
Hence, it first sublates
the otherness of this substance
and returns in it back to itself;
second, it determines this same substance,
posits this sublation of its otherness
or the substance's turning back into itself
as a determinateness.
This positedness, because it is at the same time
the substance's turning back into itself,
is at first its effect.
But conversely, because as presupposing
it determines itself as its other,
it then posits the effect in this other,
in the passive substance.
Or again, because the passive substance is itself this double,
namely a self-subsistent other,
and at the same time something presupposed
and already implicitly identical
with the efficient cause;
because of this, the action of the passive
substance is therefore itself double.
It is at once both the sublation of its determinateness,
namely of its condition,
or the sublation of the self-subsistence
of the passive substance;
and also, in sublating its identity as
it sublates this substance,
the pre-supposing of itself,
that is, the positing or supposing of itself as other.
Through this last moment,
the passive substance is preserved;
that first sublation of it appears in this respect
at the same time also in this way,
namely that only some determinations are sublated in it,
and its identity in the effect
with the efficient cause
occurs in it externally.

To this extent it suffers violence.
Violence is the appearance of power,
or power as external.
But power is something external only in so far as in its
action, that is, in the positing of itself,
the causal substance is at the same
time a presupposing, that is, posits itself as sublated.
Conversely, the act of
violence is therefore equally an act of power.
The violent cause acts only on
an other which it presupposes;
its effect on it is its negative self-reference,
or the manifestation of itself.
The passive is the self-subsistent
which is only a posited,
something internally fractured
an actuality which is condition,
though a condition that now is in its truth
as an actuality that is only a possible,
or, conversely, an in-itself that is only
the determinateness of the in-itself,
is only passive.
To that which suffers violence, therefore,
not only is it possible to do violence,
but violence must be done to it;
that which has dominion over an other,
only has it because its power is that of the other,
a power which in that dominion
manifests both itself and the other.
Through violence the passive substance
is only posited as what it is in truth,
namely, that because it is
the simple positive or the immediate substance,
for that very reason it is only something posited;
the "pre-" that it has as condition is
the reflective shine of immediacy
that the efficient causality strips off from it.

Passive substance, therefore, is only given its due
by the action on it of another power.
What it loses is the immediacy it had,
the substantiality alien to it.
What comes to it as an alien something,
namely that it is determined as a positedness,
is its own determination.
But now in being determined in its positedness,
or in its own determination,
the result is that it is not sublated
but rather that it only rejoins itself
and in its being determined is,
therefore, an originariness.
On the one hand, therefore,
the passive substance is preserved
or posited by the active,
namely in so far as the latter sublates itself;
but, on the other hand, it is the act of
the passive substance itself to rejoin itself
and thus to make itself into
what is originary and a cause.
The being posited by an other
and its own becoming
are one and the same.

Now, because the passive substance has been converted into a cause,
it follows, first, that the effect is sublated in it;
therein consists its reaction in general.
As passive substance, it is in itself as positedness;
also, positedness has been posited in it by the other substance,
namely in so far as it received its effect within it.
Its reaction contains, therefore, a twofold aspect.
For one, what it is in itself is posited.
And two, what it is as posited
displays itself as its in-itself;
it is positedness in itself,
hence through the other substance it
receives an effect within;
but, conversely, this positedness is
its own in-itself,
it is thus its own effect,
it itself displays itself as a cause.

Second, the reaction is directed at
the first efficient cause.
For the effect which the hitherto
passive substance sublates within itself
is precisely the effect of that other cause.
But a cause has its substantial actuality only in its effect;
inasmuch as this effect is sublated,
so is also the causal substantiality of the other cause.
This happens first in itself through itself, in that
the cause makes itself into an effect;
its negative determination disappears
in this identity and the cause becomes passive;
and, second, it happens through the hitherto passive,
but now reacting substance,
which sublates its effect.

Now in determinate causality
the substance acted upon becomes a cause,
for it acts against the positing of an effect in it.
But it did not react against the cause of that effect
but posited its effect rather in another substance,
and thus there arose the progression to infinity of effects;
for here the cause is only implicitly
identical with itself in the effect,
and hence, on the one hand,
it expires into an immediate identity
as it comes to rest,
but, on the other hand,
it revives in another substance.
In conditioned causality, on the contrary,
the cause refers back to itself in the effect,
for the latter is as a condition,
as a presupposition, its other,
and its act is therefore just as much a becoming
as a positing and sublating of the other.

Further, causality behaves in all this as passive substance;
but, as we have seen, the latter becomes causal
through the effect it incurs.
That first cause, the one which acts first
and receives its effect back into itself as a reaction,
thus comes up again as a cause,
whereby the activity which in finite causality
runs into the bad infinite progression
is bent around and becomes an action
that returns to itself,
an infinite reciprocal action.`,
    summary: 'Cause acts (negative power over itself, own presupposition) on passive substance: sublates otherness, returns to itself; determines substance, posits sublation/turning back as determinateness. Positedness = effect. Presupposing: posits effect in other. Passive substance = double (self-subsistent other, presupposed, implicitly identical). Action double: sublation of determinateness/condition/self-subsistence; pre-supposing of itself (positing as other). Passive preserved, some determinations sublated, identity externally. Suffers violence. Violence = appearance of power (external). Power external: causal substance presupposing, posits itself as sublated. Violence = act of power. Passive = self-subsistent posited, internally fractured, condition (actuality = possible, in-itself = determinateness, only passive). Violence must be done; dominion = power of other, manifests both. Violence posits passive as posited (simple positive/immediate = posited, "pre-" = reflective shine stripped). Passive given due by action. Loses immediacy/substantiality. Determined as positedness = own determination. Determined = not sublated, rejoins itself, originariness. Preserved by active (active sublates itself); passive rejoins itself, makes itself cause. Posited by other = own becoming. Passive converted to cause: effect sublated = reaction. Passive = in itself as positedness, positedness posited by other. Reaction twofold: in itself posited; as posited displays as in-itself (positedness in itself, own in-itself, own effect, displays as cause). Reaction directed at first cause. Effect sublated = causal substantiality sublated. Cause makes itself effect (becomes passive); reacting substance sublates effect. Determinate causality: substance acted upon becomes cause (acts against positing effect). Did not react, posited effect in another = infinite progression. Cause implicitly identical, expires/revives. Conditioned causality: cause refers back to itself (effect = condition/presupposition/other, becoming = positing/sublating). Causality as passive becomes causal. First cause receives reaction, comes up again, activity bent around = action returning to itself = infinite reciprocal action.'
