The second of these extremes is the negative as negative,
the reflection external to the absolute.
Or inasmuch as the negative is
taken as the inner of the absolute
and its own determination is to posit itself as mode,
it is then the self-externality of the absolute,
the loss of itself in the
changeability and contingency of being,
its having passed over into its opposite
without turning back into itself,
the manifoldness of form and content
determinations that lacks totality.`,

In actual fact, therefore, the absolute is first posited

But it has in fact found the determinateness
from which it begins in the absolute itself.
For as first undifferentiated identity,
the absolute is itself only the determinate absolute,
or attribute, because it is the unmoved,
still unreflected absolute.
This determinateness, since it is determinateness,
belongs to the reflective movement,

that the absolute is determined as the first identity;
through it alone that it has absolute form
and does not just exist as self-equal
