    title: 'Absolute idea as identity — all truth',
    text: `The absolute idea has shown itself to be
the identity of the theoretical and the practical idea,
each of which, of itself still one-sided, possesses the idea
only as a sought-for beyond and unattained goal;
each is therefore a synthesis of striving,
each possessing as well as not possessing the idea within it,
passing over from one thought to the other
without bringing the two together
but remaining fixed in the contradiction of the two.
The absolute idea, as the rational concept
that in its reality only rejoins itself,
is by virtue of this immediacy of its objective identity,
on the one hand, a turning back to life;
on the other hand, it has equally
sublated this form of its immediacy
and harbors the most extreme opposition within.
The concept is not only soul,
but free subjective concept
that exists for itself
and therefore has personality,
the practical objective concept
that is determined in and for itself
and is as person impenetrable, atomic subjectivity
but which is not, just the same, exclusive singularity;
it is rather explicitly universality and cognition,
and in its other has its own objectivity for its subject matter.
All the rest is error, confusion, opinion,
striving, arbitrariness, and transitoriness;
the absolute idea alone is being, imperishable life,
self-knowing truth, and is all truth.

It is the sole subject matter and content of philosophy.
Since it contains all determinateness within it,
and its essence consists in returning
through its self-determination
and particularization back to itself,
it has various shapes,
and the business of philosophy
is to recognize it in these.
Nature and spirit are in general
different modes of exhibiting its existence,
art and religion its different modes of apprehending itself
and giving itself appropriate existence.
Philosophy has the same content and the same
purpose as art and religion,
but it is the highest mode of apprehending the absolute idea,
because its mode, that of the concept, is the highest.`,
    summary: 'Absolute idea = identity of theoretical and practical idea. Each one-sided, idea as beyond/unattained goal, synthesis of striving, contradiction. Absolute idea = rational concept rejoining itself, turning back to life, sublated immediacy, extreme opposition. Concept = soul + free subjective concept + personality + practical objective concept + universality/cognition. Absolute idea alone = being/imperishable life/self-knowing truth/all truth. Sole subject matter of philosophy, contains all determinateness, returns through self-determination. Various shapes, philosophy recognizes it. Nature/spirit = modes of exhibiting, art/religion = modes of apprehending. Philosophy = highest mode (concept highest).'

    text: `Also the logicality of the absolute idea
can be called a mode of it;
but mode signifies a particular kind,
a determinateness of form,
whereas the logicality of the idea is
the universal mode in which
all particular modes are sublated and enveloped.
The logical idea is the idea itself in its pure essence,
the idea which is enclosed in
simple identity within its concept
and in reflective shining has as yet
to step into a form-determinateness.
The Logic thus exhibits the
self-movement of the absolute idea
only as the original word,
a word which is an utterance,
but one that in being externally uttered
has immediately vanished again.
The idea is, therefore, only in this
self-determination of apprehending itself;
it is in pure thought, where difference is not yet otherness,
but is and remains perfectly transparent to itself.
The logical idea thus has itself,
as the infinite form, for its content,
form that constitutes the opposite of content
inasmuch as the latter is the form determination
that has withdrawn into itself
and has been so sublated in identity
that this concrete identity stands over against
the identity developed as form;
the content has the shape of an other
and of something given as against the form
that as such stands simply in reference,
and whose determinateness is posited
at the same time as reflective shine.
More exactly, the absolute idea itself has
only this for its content,
namely that the form determination is
its own completed totality, the pure content.
Now the determinateness of the idea
and the entire course traversed by this determinateness
has constituted the subject matter of the science of logic,
and out of this course the absolute idea has come forth for itself;
thus to be for itself, however, has shown itself to amount to this,
namely that determinateness does not
have the shape of a content,
but that it is simply as form,
and that accordingly the idea is
the absolutely universal idea.
What is left to be considered here, therefore,
is thus not a content as such,
but the universal character of its form
that is, method.

Method may appear at first to be just
the manner in which cognition proceeds,
and this is in fact its nature.
But as method this manner of proceeding is
not only a modality of being determined in and for itself;
it is a modality of cognition,
and as such is posited as determined
by the concept and as form,
since form is the soul of all objectivity
and all otherwise determined content has its truth in form alone.
If the content is again assumed as given to the method
and of a nature of its own, then method, so understood,
is just like the logical realm in general,
a merely external form.
But against this assumption appeal can be made,
not only to the fundamental concept of what constitutes logic,
but to the entire logical course
in which all the shapes of a given content
and of objects came up for consideration.
This course has shown the transitoriness
and the untruth of all such shapes;
also that no given object is capable of being the foundation
to which the absolute form would relate
as only an external and accidental determination;
that, on the contrary, it is the absolute form
that has proved itself to be the absolute foundation
and the ultimate truth.
For this course the method has resulted as
the absolutely self-knowing concept,
as the concept that has the absolute,
both as subjective and objective,
as its subject matter,
and consequently as the pure correspondence
of the concept and its reality,
a concrete existence that is the concept itself.

Accordingly, what is to be considered as method here is
only the movement of the concept itself.
We already know the nature of this movement,
but it now has, first, the added significance
that the concept is all,
and that its movement is the universal absolute activity,
the self-determining and self-realizing movement.
The method is therefore to be acknowledged as the universal,
internal and external mode, free of restrictions,
and as the absolutely infinite force to which
no object that may present itself as something external,
removed from reason and independent of it,
could offer resistance,
or be of a particular nature opposite to it,
and could not be penetrated by it.
It is therefore soul and substance,
and nothing is conceived and known in its truth
unless completely subjugated to the method;
it is the method proper to each and every fact
because its activity is the concept.
This is also the truer meaning of its universality;
according to the universality of reflection,
it is taken only as the method for all things;
but according to the universality of the idea,
it is both the manner of cognition,
of the concept subjectively aware of itself,
and the objective manner, or rather the
substantiality of things, that is,
of concepts as they first appear as others
to representation and reflection.
It is therefore not only the highest force of reason,
or rather its sole and absolute force,
but also reason's highest and sole impulse
to find and recognize itself through itself in all things.`,
    summary: 'Logicality = universal mode (all modes sublated/enveloped). Logical idea = pure essence, simple identity, reflective shining. Logic exhibits self-movement = original word (uttered, vanished). Idea = self-determination apprehending itself, pure thought, transparent. Logical idea = infinite form as content. Form determination = completed totality = pure content. Determinateness = form (not content), idea = absolutely universal. Left to consider = universal character of form = method. Method = manner of cognition proceeding, modality determined by concept, form = soul of objectivity. Content given to method = external form. Absolute form = absolute foundation/ultimate truth. Method = absolutely self-knowing concept, pure correspondence of concept and reality. Method = movement of concept itself, concept = all, universal absolute activity. Method = universal/internal/external mode, infinite force, soul/substance, proper to each fact. Universality = manner of cognition + substantiality of things. Highest/sole force of reason, impulse to find/recognize itself.'

    title: 'Transition to nature',
    text: `In conclusion, there remains only this to be said of this idea,
that in it, in the first place,
the science of logic has apprehended its own concept.
In the sphere of being, at the beginning of its content,
its concept appears as a knowledge external to
that content in subjective reflection.
But in the idea of absolute cognition,
the concept has become the idea's own content.
The idea is itself the pure concept
that has itself as its subject matter
and which, as it runs itself as subject matter
through the totality of its determinations,
builds itself up to the entirety of its reality,
to the system of science,
and concludes by apprehending this
conceptual comprehension of itself,
hence by sublating its position
as content and subject matter
and cognizing the concept of science.
In second place, this idea is still logical;
it is shut up in pure thought,
the science only of the divine concept.
Its systematic exposition is of course itself a realization,
but one confined within the same sphere.
Because the pure idea of cognition is
to this extent shut up within subjectivity,
it is the impulse to sublate it,
and pure truth becomes as final result
also the beginning of another sphere and science.
It only remains here to indicate this transition.

The idea, namely, in positing itself
as the absolute unity of the pure concept and its reality
and thus collecting itself in the immediacy of being,
is in this form as totality:  nature.
This determination, however, is nothing that has become,
is not a transition, as was the case above
when the subjective concept in its totality becomes objectivity,
or the subjective purpose becomes life.
The pure idea into which the determinateness
or reality of the concept is itself
raised into concept is rather an
absolute liberation for which
there is no longer an immediate determination
which is not equally posited and is not concept;
in this freedom, therefore, there is
no transition that takes place;
the simple being to which the idea determines itself
remains perfectly transparent to it:
it is the idea that in its determination remains with itself.
The transition is to be grasped, therefore,
in the sense that the idea freely discharges itself,
absolutely certain of itself and internally at rest.
On account of this freedom, the form of
its determinateness is just as absolutely free:
the externality of space and time absolutely existing
for itself without subjectivity.
Inasmuch as this externality is only
in the abstract determinateness of being
and is apprehended by consciousness,
it is as mere objectivity and external life;
within the idea, however, it remains in
and for itself the totality of the concept,
and science in the relation of
divine cognition to nature.
But what is posited by this first resolve
of the pure idea to determine itself as external idea
is only the mediation out of which the concept,
as free concrete existence that from externality
has come to itself, raises itself up,
completes this self-liberation in the science of spirit,
and in the science of logic finds the highest concept of itself,
the pure concept conceptually comprehending itself.`,
    summary: 'Logic has apprehended its own concept. In being, concept external to content. In absolute cognition, concept = idea\'s own content. Idea = pure concept with itself as subject matter, runs through determinations, builds to system of science, apprehends conceptual comprehension, sublates position, cognizes concept of science. Idea still logical, shut up in pure thought, science of divine concept. Impulse to sublate subjectivity, pure truth = beginning of another sphere. Transition: idea positing itself as absolute unity = nature (totality). Not transition (not become), but absolute liberation. No immediate determination not posited/concept. Idea freely discharges itself, certain/at rest. Form = absolutely free, externality of space/time without subjectivity. Externality = objectivity/external life (for consciousness), but within idea = totality of concept. Mediation: concept raises itself up, completes self-liberation in spirit, finds highest concept in logic.'
