    title: 'The advance — analytic, synthetic, dialectical',
    text: `The concrete totality which makes the beginning
possesses as such, within it, the beginning of
the advance and development.
As concrete, it is differentiated in itself,
but because of its initial immediacy, this first
differentiation is to start with a diversity.
However, as self-referring universality, as subject,
the immediate is also the unity of this diversity.
This reflection is the first stage of the forward movement
the emergence of non-indifference, judgment, and determining in general.
Essential is that the method find, and recognize,
the determination of the universal within it.
Whatever in this abstractive generation of the universal
is left out of the concrete is then picked up, still externally,
by the finite cognition of the understanding.
This is how the latter operates.
The absolute method, on the contrary, does not behave
in this manner of external reflection
but takes the determinate from its subject matter,
for it is itself its immanent principle and its soul.
This is what Plato demanded of cognition,
that it should consider things in and for themselves;
on the one hand, that it should consider them in their universality;
on the other hand, that it should not stray away from them
while it grasps at circumstances, examples, and comparisons,
but, on the contrary, should keep only them in view before it
and bring to consciousness what is immanent in them.
To this extent the method of absolute cognition is analytic.
That the method finds the further determinations
of its initial universal simply and solely in this universal,
constitutes the concept's absolute objectivity,
of which the method is the certainty.
Equally so, however, is the method synthetic,
for its subject matter,
while immediately determined as the simple universal,
through the determinateness which it has
in its very immediacy and universality,
proves to be an other.
Yet this connection in diversity
that the subject matter is thus in itself,
is no longer a synthesis as understood in finite cognition;
the no less thoroughly analytic determination of the subject matter,
the fact that the connection is within the concept,
already distinguishes it fully from the latter synthesis.

This no less synthetic than analytic moment of the judgment
through which the initial universal determines itself
from within itself as the other of itself
is to be called the dialectical moment.
Dialectic is one of those ancient sciences
that have been the most misjudged in
the metaphysics of the moderns,
and in general also by popular philosophy,
both ancient and recent.
It must be regarded as an infinitely important step
that dialectic is once more being
recognized as necessary to reason,
although the result that must be drawn from it
is the opposite than Kant drew.

The fundamental prejudice here is that
dialectic has only a negative result,
a point about which more in a moment.
First, regarding the said form in which dialectic
usually makes its appearance,
it is to be observed that according to that form
the dialectic and its result affect
a subject matter which is previously assumed
or also the subjective cognition of it,
and declare either the latter or the subject matter
to be null and void,
while, on the contrary, no attention is given to
the determinations which are exhibited in the subject matter
as in a third thing and presupposed as valid for themselves.
To have called attention to this uncritical procedure has
been the infinite merit of the Kantian philosophy,
and in so doing to have given the impetus to the restoration
of logic and dialectic understood as the examination of
thought determinations in and for themselves.
The subject matter, as it is apart from thought and conceptualization,
is a picture representation or also a name;
it is in the determinations of thought and of the concept
that it is what it is.
In fact, therefore, everything rests on these determinations;
they are the true subject matter and content of reason,
and anything else that might be understood by subject matter and content
in distinction from them has meaning only through them and in them.
It must not therefore be taken as the fault of a subject matter
or of the cognition that these determinations,
because of what they are and the way they are externally joined,
prove to be dialectical.
On this assumption, the subject matter and the cognition
are imagined to be a subject on which
the determinations are brought to bear,
in the form of predicates, properties,
or self-subsistent universals,
as fixed and independently correct,
so that these determinations are
brought into dialectical relations
and incur contradiction only by
extraneous and contingent conjunction
in and by a third thing.
But this kind of external and fixed
subject of imagination and understanding,
and also these abstract determinations,
cannot be regarded as ultimates,
as secure and permanent substrates.
On the contrary, they are to be regarded as themselves immediate,
precisely the kind of presuppositions and starting points which,
as we have shown above, must succumb to dialectic in and for themselves,
because they are to be taken as in themselves the concept.

Now this is the very standpoint indicated above
from which a universal prius,
considered in and for itself,
proves to be the other of itself.
Taken quite generally, this determination
can be taken to mean that what is at first immediate
is therewith posited as mediated, as referred to an other,
or that the universal is posited as a particular.
The second universal that has thereby arisen is
thus the negative of that first
and, in view of subsequent developments, the first negative.
From this negative side, the immediate has perished in the other;
but the other is essentially not an empty negative,
the nothing which is normally taken to be the result of dialectic,
but is rather the other of the first,
the negative of the immediate;
it is therefore determined as the mediated,
contains as such the determination of the first in it.
The first is thus essentially preserved and contained also in the other.
To hold fast to the positive in its negative,
to the content of the presupposition in the result,
this is the most important factor in rational cognition;
what is more, it takes only the simplest of reflections
to be convinced of the absolute truth and necessity of this requirement,
and as for examples of proofs that testify to this,
the whole Logic consists of such proofs.

So what we now have, taken first or also immediately, is the mediated,
also a simple determination,
for the first has perished in it,
and only the second is therefore at hand.
Now since the first is contained in the second,
and this second is the truth of the first,
this unity of the two can be expressed
in the form of a proposition in which
the immediate is placed as the subject
but the mediated as its predicate;
for example, "the finite is infinite,"
"one is many," "the singular is the universal."
The inadequacy of the form of such
propositions and judgments is however obvious.
In connection with judgment it was shown that its form in general,
and most of all the immediate form of the positive judgment,
is incapable of holding within its grasp
the speculative content and the truth.

The second determination, the negative or mediated determination,
is moreover at the same time the one that mediates.
At first it may be taken as a simple determination,
but its truth is that it is a reference or relation;
for it is the negative, but the negative of the positive,
and it includes this positive within itself.
It is the other, therefore, not of a one to which it is indifferent;
in that case it would not be an other, nor a reference or relation.
It is rather the other in itself, the other of an other;
hence it includes its own other within itself
and is consequently the contradiction, the posited dialectic, of itself.
Because the first or the immediate is the concept in itself or implicitly,
and therefore is the negative also only implicitly,
the dialectical moment in it consists in the positing
of the difference that is implicitly contained in it.
The second is on the contrary itself the determinate,
the difference or relation;
hence the dialectical moment consists in its case
in the positing of the unity contained within it.

Now the negativity just considered constitutes
the turning point of the movement of the concept.
It is the simple point of the negative self-reference,
the innermost source of all activity,
of living and spiritual self-movement;
it is the dialectical soul
which everything true possesses
and through which alone it is true;
for on this subjectivity alone rests
the sublation of the opposition
between concept and reality,
and the unity which is truth.
The second negative at which we have arrived,
the negative of the negative,
is this sublating of contradiction,
and it too, just like contradiction,
is not an act of external reflection;
for it is on the contrary the innermost,
objective moment of the life of spirit
by virtue of which a subject is a person, is free.

Now, on closer examination, the third is the immediate,
but the immediate through sublation of mediation,
the simple through the sublating of difference,
the positive through the sublating of the negative;
it is the concept that has realized itself through its otherness,
and through the sublating of this reality has rejoined itself
and has restored its absolute reality,
its simple self-reference.
This result is therefore the truth.
It is just as much immediacy as mediation
though these forms of judgments,
that the third is immediacy and mediation,
or that it is the unity of the two,
are not capable of grasping it,
for it is not a dormant third
but, exactly like this unity,
self-mediating movement and activity.
Just as that with which we began was the universal,
so the result is the singular, the concrete, the subject;
what the former is in itself, the latter is now equally for itself:
the universal is posited in the subject.

By virtue of the nature of the method just indicated,
the science presents itself as a circle that winds around itself,
where the mediation winds the end back to the beginning
which is the simple ground;
the circle is thus a circle of circles,
for each single member ensouled by the method
is reflected into itself so that, in returning to the beginning
it is at the same time the beginning of a new member.
Fragments of this chain are the single sciences,
each of which has a before and an after
or, more accurately said,
has in possession only the before
and in its conclusion points to its after.

So the logic also has returned in the absolute idea
to this simple unity which is its beginning;
the pure immediacy of being,
in which all determination appears at first
as extinguished or removed by abstraction,
is the idea that through mediation,
that is, the sublation of mediation,
has come to the likeness corresponding to it.
The method is the pure concept
that only relates to itself;
it is, therefore, the simple self-reference which is being.
But it now is also the fulfilled concept,
the concept that comprehends itself conceptually,
being as the concrete and just as absolutely intensive totality.`,
    summary: 'Concrete totality = beginning of advance. Differentiated in itself, but immediacy = diversity. Self-referring universality = unity of diversity. Reflection = first stage = non-indifference/judgment/determining. Method finds determination of universal within it. Absolute method = immanent principle/soul, takes determinate from subject matter. Method = analytic (finds determinations in universal) + synthetic (universal proves to be other). Connection in diversity = within concept. Dialectical moment = judgment through which universal determines itself as other. Dialectic = necessary to reason. Prejudice: dialectic = only negative result. Determinations = true subject matter/content of reason. Determinations prove dialectical in themselves. Universal prius = other of itself. Immediate = mediated, universal = particular. Second universal = negative of first = first negative. Other = not empty negative, contains first, first preserved. Hold fast to positive in negative = important factor. Second = truth of first, unity expressed. Second = mediates, reference/relation, includes positive, contradiction. Dialectical moment = positing difference (first) or unity (second). Negativity = turning point, negative self-reference, innermost source, dialectical soul. Second negative = sublation of contradiction, innermost moment of spirit. Third = immediate through sublation of mediation, concept realized through otherness, truth. Result = singular/concrete/subject, universal posited in subject. Science = circle winding around itself, circle of circles. Logic returned to simple unity = beginning. Method = pure concept relating to itself = being. Method = fulfilled concept = concrete intensive totality.'
