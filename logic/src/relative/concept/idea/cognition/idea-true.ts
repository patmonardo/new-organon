    title: 'Impulse of truth — theoretical idea',
    text: `At first the subjective idea is impulse.
For it is the contradiction of the concept
that it has itself for the subject matter
and is to itself the reality without, however,
the subject matter being an other that subsists
on its own over against it,
or without the differentiation
of itself from itself
having at the same time
the essential determination of diversity
and of indifferent existence.
The specific nature of this impulse is therefore
to sublate its own subjectivity,
to make that first abstract reality a concrete one,
filling it with the content of the world
presupposed by its subjectivity.
From the other side, the impulse is determined in this way:
the concept is indeed the absolute certainty of itself;
however, opposite its being-for-itself
there stands its presupposition of a world
that exists in itself,
but one whose indifferent otherness
has for the concept's certainty of itself
the status of something merely unessential;
the concept is therefore the impulse
to sublate this otherness
and, in the object, to intuit
its identity with itself.
This immanent reflection is
the sublated opposition
and the singularity that originally
makes its appearance as
the presupposed being-in-itself
but is now posited and made actual for the subject;
accordingly, this being-in-itself is
the self-identity of the form
as it has issued from the opposition,
an identity which is therefore determined as
indifferent towards the form
in its differentiation.
It is content.

Consequently this impulse is
the impulse of truth in so far as
the truth is in cognition,
and therefore of truth in its strict sense
as theoretical idea.
Although objective truth is
the idea itself as the reality
that corresponds to the concept,
and to this extent a subject matter
may or may not possess truth,
nevertheless the more precise meaning of truth is
that it is such for or in
the subjective concept, in knowledge.
Truth is the relation of the
judgment of the concept,
the concept that proved to be
the formal judgment of truth;
for the predicate in this judgment is
not only the objectivity of the concept,
but the comparison connecting
the concept of the fact
with the actuality of it.
This realization of the concept is theoretical
in so far as the concept still has, as form,
the determination of subjectivity, or in so far
as it has for the subject the determination of
being its own determination.`,
    summary: 'Subjective idea = impulse. Contradiction: concept has itself as subject matter, is reality, but subject matter not other subsisting, differentiation not having diversity/indifferent existence. Impulse = sublate subjectivity, make abstract reality concrete, fill with world content. Concept = absolute certainty, presupposition of world existing in itself, indifferent otherness = unessential. Impulse = sublate otherness, intuit identity in object. Immanent reflection = sublated opposition, singularity posited/made actual = content. Impulse = impulse of truth = theoretical idea. Truth = relation of judgment of concept, comparison connecting concept with actuality. Realization = theoretical (concept has subjectivity as form).'

    title: 'Finite cognition — contradiction',
    text: `Because cognition is the idea as purpose
or as subjective idea,
the negation of the world,
presupposed as existing in itself,
is the first negation;
the conclusion in which the objective is posited
in the subjective has at first, therefore,
only the meaning that what exists in itself is
posited only as something subjective,
only in conceptual determination,
and consequently does not exist as
so posited in and for itself.
Thus the conclusion only attains
to a neutral unity, or a synthesis,
that is, to a unity of terms that
are originally separate, only externally conjoined.
Hence, since in this cognition the concept
posits the object as its own,
the idea gives itself at first
only a content of which the foundation is given,
in which only the form of externality has been sublated.
To this extent, this cognition still retains
its finitude in its realized purpose;
in the realized purpose, it has at the same time
not attained its purpose,
and in its truth it has not arrived at the truth.
For in so far as in the result
the content still has
the determination of a given,
the presupposed being-in-itself confronting
the concept is not sublated;
the unity of concept and reality, the truth,
is thereby equally not contained in it.
Remarkable is that this side of finitude is
the one that of late has been clung to
and accepted as the absolute relation of cognition
as if the finite as such were to be the absolute!
On this view, an unknown thinghood-in-itself is
attributed to the object, behind cognition,
and this thinghood, and the truth also along with it,
are regarded for cognition as an absolute beyond.
Thought determinations in general, the categories,
the determinations of reflection,
as well as the formal concept and its moments,
acquire on this view the status of
determinations that are finite,
not in and for themselves,
but in the sense of being
something subjective as against
this empty thinghood-in-itself;
the fallacy of taking this
untrue relation of cognition as
the true relation has become
the universal opinion of modern times.

It is immediately clear from this definition
of finite cognition that it is
a contradiction that sublates itself;
it is the contradiction of a truth that
is supposed at the same time not to be truth,
of a cognition of what is that at the same time
does not know the thing-in-itself.
In the collapse of this contradiction, its content,
subjective cognition and the thing-in-itself,
collapses, that is, proves itself to be an untruth.
But it is incumbent upon cognition itself to resolve
its finitude by its own forward movement
and along with it its contradiction.`,
    summary: 'Cognition = idea as purpose/subjective idea, first negation of world. Conclusion: objective posited in subjective = only subjective/conceptual, not in and for itself. Conclusion = neutral unity/synthesis, externally conjoined. Idea gives itself content with given foundation, externality sublated. Cognition retains finitude, not attained purpose, not arrived at truth. Content = given, being-in-itself not sublated, truth not contained. Finitude clung to as absolute relation. Thing-in-itself behind cognition, truth as absolute beyond. Determinations = finite/subjective. Fallacy = universal opinion. Finite cognition = contradiction that sublates itself: truth that is not truth, cognition that does not know thing-in-itself. Contradiction collapses, content proves untruth. Cognition must resolve finitude by forward movement.'

    title: 'Analytic and synthetic cognition',
    text: `The specific difference of analytic cognition is
already established by the fact that,
since it is the first premise of the whole syllogism,
mediation does not as yet belong to it;
analytic cognition is rather
the immediate communication of the concept,
a communication that does not as yet contain otherness
and in which activity divests itself of its negativity.
Yet this immediacy of the connection is
for that reason itself mediation,
for it is a negative reference of the concept to
the object that annuls itself
and thereby makes itself simple and identical.
This immanent reflection is only subjective,
because in its mediation the difference is
present still in the form of a presupposition
existing in itself,
as the object's difference within itself.
The determination that results
through this connection, therefore,
is the form of simple identity,
of abstract universality.
Accordingly, analytic cognition has in general
this identity for its principle,
and the transition into an other,
the linking of different terms is
excluded from it and from its activity.

Analysis, since it is based on the concept,
has for its products determinations
that are essentially conceptual,
though such as are contained in the subject matter immediately.
We have seen from the nature of the idea of cognition
that the activity of the subjective concept
must be regarded from one side only as
the explication of what is already in the object,
for the object itself is nothing
but the totality of the concept.
It is just as one-sided to portray analysis
as though there were nothing in the subject matter
that is not imported into it,
as it is to suppose that
the resulting determinations are
only extracted from it.
The former way of stating the case corresponds,
as is well known, to subjective idealism,
which takes the activity of cognition in analysis
to be only a one-sided positing,
beyond which the thing-in-itself remains hidden.
The other way belongs to the so-called realism,
for which the subjective concept is an
empty identity that imports
the thought determinations from outside.
Since analytical cognition,
the transformation of the given material
into logical determinations,
has shown itself to be a positing
that immediately determines itself to
be equally a presupposing,
to be both in one,
the logical element can appear
on account of this presupposing to be in
the subject matter as something already completed,
just as because of the positing it can
appear as the product of a merely subjective activity.
But the two moments are not to be separated.`,
    summary: 'Analytic cognition = first premise, no mediation, immediate communication of concept, no otherness, activity divests negativity. Immediacy = mediation = negative reference annulling itself = simple/identical. Immanent reflection = subjective, difference as presupposition. Result = simple identity/abstract universality. Principle = identity, transition/linking excluded. Analysis = based on concept, products = conceptual determinations. Object = totality of concept. One-sided: subjective idealism (one-sided positing, thing-in-itself hidden) vs realism (empty identity, imports from outside). Analytical cognition = positing = presupposing, both in one. Logical element = in subject matter (presupposing) = product of activity (positing). Two moments not separated.'
