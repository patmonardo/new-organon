    title: 'The idea as adequate concept — objectively true',
    text: `The idea is the adequate concept,
the objectively true,
or the true as such.
If anything has truth,
it has it by virtue of its idea,
or something has truth only
in so far as it is idea.
The expression "idea" has otherwise also often been used
in philosophy as well as in ordinary life for "concept,"
or even for just a "representation."
To say that I still have no idea of
this lawsuit, this building, this region,
means nothing more than I still have no representation of it.
It is Kant who reclaimed the expression "idea"
for the "concept of reason."
Now according to Kant the concept of reason
should be the concept of the unconditional,
but a concept which is transcendent
with respect to appearances,
that is, one for which no adequate empirical use can be made.
The concepts of reason are supposed to serve
for the comprehension of perceptions,
those of the understanding for the understanding of them.
In fact, however, if these last
concepts of the understanding are truly concepts,
then they are comprehensions, which means concepts;
they will make comprehending possible,
and an understanding of perceptions
through concepts of the understanding
will be a comprehending.
But if understanding is only
the determining of perceptions by categories
such as whole and parts, force, cause, and the like,
then it signifies only a determining by means of reflection,
just as by understanding one may mean only the determinate
representation of a fully determined sensuous content;
as when someone is being shown the way,
that at the end of the wood he must turn left,
and he replies "I understand,"
understanding means nothing more than a grasp
in pictorial representation and in memory.
"Concept of reason," too, is a somewhat clumsy expression;
for the concept is in general something rational,
and in so far as reason is distinguished
from the understanding and the concept as such,
it is the totality of the concept and objectivity.
The idea is the rational in this sense;
it is the unconditioned,
because only that has conditions
which essentially refers to an objectivity
that it does not determine itself
but which still stands over against it
in the form of indifference and externality,
just as the external purpose had conditions.`,
    summary: 'Idea = adequate concept = objectively true = true as such. Truth = by virtue of idea. Kant: idea = concept of reason = unconditional, transcendent. Understanding concepts = comprehensions. Reason = totality of concept and objectivity. Idea = unconditioned (no conditions referring to indifferent externality).'

    id: 'idea-intro-2-idea-not-merely-subjective',
    title: 'Idea not merely subjective — objective validity',
    text: `If we now reserve the expression "idea"
for the objective or real concept
and we distinguish it from the concept itself
and still more from mere representation,
then we must also even more definitely reject
that estimate of it according to which
the idea is something with no actuality,
and true thoughts are accordingly said to be only ideas.
If thoughts are something merely subjective and contingent,
then they certainly have no further value;
but in this they do not stand lower
than the temporal and contingent actualities
which likewise have no further value than
that of accidentalities and appearances.
But if, on the contrary, the idea is
supposed not to have the value of truth
because in regard to appearances it is transcendent,
because no congruent object can be given for it
in the world of the senses,
then this is indeed an odd misunderstanding,
for objective validity is being denied to it
on the ground that it lacks precisely what makes
of appearances the untrue being of the objective world.
In regard to the practical ideas, Kant recognizes that
"nothing can be more harmful and unworthy of
a philosopher than the vulgar appeal to experience,
which supposedly contradicts the idea.
Any such alleged contradiction would not be there at all
if, for example, political institutions were set up
at the right time in accordance with ideas,
and if crude concepts, crude just
because they are drawn from experience,
had not usurped the place of ideas
thus thwarting all good intentions."
Kant regards the idea as something necessary,
the goal which, as the archetype,
we must strive to set up as a maximum
and to which we must bring actuality
as it presently stands ever closer.`,
    summary: 'Idea = objective/real concept (not mere representation). Reject: idea = no actuality, true thoughts = only ideas. Subjective/contingent thoughts = no value, but same as temporal/contingent actualities. Denying truth because transcendent = misunderstanding (denies objective validity because lacks what makes appearances untrue). Kant: practical ideas necessary, archetype/goal, bring actuality closer.'

    id: 'idea-intro-3-unity-concept-objectivity',
    title: 'Unity of concept and objectivity — not mere goal',
    text: `But since the result now is that the idea is
the unity of the concept and objectivity, the true,
we must not regard it as just a goal
which is to be approximated
but itself remains always a kind of beyond;
we must rather regard everything as being actual
only to the extent that it has the idea
in it and expresses it.
It is not just that the subject matter,
the objective and the subjective world,
ought to be in principle congruent with the idea;
the two are themselves rather the
congruence of concept and reality;
a reality that does not correspond
to the concept is mere appearance,
something subjective, accidental, arbitrary,
something which is not the truth.
When it is said that there is no subject matter
to be found in experience
which is perfectly congruent with the idea,
the latter is opposed to the actual
as a subjective standard;
but there is no saying what
anything actual might possibly be in truth,
if its concept is not in it
and its objectivity does not
measure up to this concept;
it would then be a nothing.
Indeed, the mechanical and the chemical object,
like a subject devoid of spirit
and a spirit conscious only of finitude
and not of its essence,
do not, according to their various natures,
have their concept concretely existing in them
in its own free form.
But they can be something at all true
only in so far as they are the union
of their concept and reality,
of their soul and their body.
Wholes like the state and the church
cease to exist in concreto when the unity
of their concept and their reality is dissolved;
the human being, the living thing, is dead
when soul and body are parted in it;
dead nature, the mechanical and the chemical
world that is, when "the dead" is taken
to mean the inorganic world,
for the expression would otherwise have
no positive meaning at all,
this dead nature, then, if it is separated
into its concept and its reality,
is nothing but the subjective abstraction of
a thought form and a formless matter.
Spirit that were not idea,
not the unity of the concept with itself,
not the concept that has the concept itself as its reality,
would be dead spirit, spiritless spirit, a material object.`,
    summary: 'Idea = unity of concept and objectivity = true. Not mere goal to approximate, but everything actual only insofar as has idea in it. Subject matter = congruence of concept and reality. Reality not corresponding to concept = mere appearance. No concept in actual = nothing. Mechanical/chemical objects, spiritless subjects = no concept in free form. True only as union of concept and reality, soul and body. State/church cease when unity dissolved. Human/living thing dead when soul/body parted. Dead nature separated = subjective abstraction. Spirit not idea = dead spirit.'

    id: 'idea-intro-4-being-attains-truth',
    title: 'Being attains truth — finite things',
    text: `Since the idea is the unity of the concept and reality,
being has attained the significance of truth;
it now is, therefore, only what the idea is.
Finite things are finite because
and to the extent that,
they do not possess the reality of
their concept completely within them
but are in need of other things for it
or, conversely,
because they are presupposed as objects
and consequently the concept is in them
as an external determination.
The highest to which they attain on
the side of this finitude is external purposiveness.
That actual things are not congruent with the idea
constitutes the side of their finitude, of their untruth,
and it is according to this side that they are objects,
each in accordance with its specific sphere,
and, in the relations of objectivity, determined
as mechanical, chemical, or by an external purpose.
That the idea has not perfectly fashioned their reality,
that it has not completely subjugated it to the concept,
the possibility of that rests on the fact that
the idea itself has a restricted content;
that, as essentially as it is
the unity of the concept and reality,
just as essentially it is also their difference;
for only the object is the immediate unity, that is,
the unity that only exists in itself.
But if a subject matter, say the state,
did not at all conform to its idea,
that is to say, if it were not rather
the idea of the state;
if its reality, which is the self-conscious individuals,
did not correspond at all to the concept,
its soul and body would have come apart;
the soul would have taken refuge in the secluded regions of thought,
the body been dispersed into singular individualities.
But because the concept of the state is essential
to the nature of these individualities,
it is present in them as so mighty an impulse
that they are driven to translate it into reality,
be it only in the form of external purposiveness,
or to put up with it as it is,
or else they must needs perish.
The worst state, one whose reality least corresponds to the concept,
in so far as it still has concrete existence, is yet idea;
the individuals still obey the power of a concept.`,
    summary: 'Idea = unity of concept and reality, being attains truth. Finite things = finite because do not possess reality of concept completely, need other things, or concept external. Highest finitude = external purposiveness. Not congruent with idea = finitude/untruth. Idea has restricted content, unity and difference. Object = immediate unity (in itself). State not conforming to idea = soul/body apart. Concept essential, present as impulse, drives to reality. Worst state still idea, individuals obey concept.'

    id: 'idea-intro-5-subjective-objective-unity',
    title: 'Subjective and objective concept — subject-object',
    text: `But the idea has not only
the general meaning of true being,
of the unity of concept and reality,
but also the more particular one
of the unity of subjective concept and objectivity.
For the concept is as such itself
already the identity of itself and reality;
for the indeterminate expression "reality"
means nothing but determinate being,
and this the concept possesses
in its particularity and singularity.
Objectivity, moreover, is likewise the total concept
that has withdrawn into identity with itself
out of its determinateness.
In the subjectivity of the concept,
the determinateness
or the difference of the latter is
a reflective shine which is immediately sublated,
withdrawn into being-for-itself
or into negative unity,
an inhering predicate.
But in this objectivity the determinateness is
posited as immediate totality, as external whole.
Now the idea has shown itself to be the concept
liberated again into its subjectivity
from the immediacy into which it has sunk in the object;
it is the concept that
distinguishes itself from its objectivity
but an objectivity which is no less determined by it
and possesses its substantiality only in that concept.
This identity has therefore rightly been
designated as a subject-object,
for it is just as well the formal
or subjective concept
as it is the object as such.
But this is a point that needs further precision.
The concept, inasmuch as it has truly attained its reality,
is this absolute judgment whose subject distinguishes itself
as self-referring negative unity from its objectivity
and is the latter's being-in-and-for-itself;
but it refers to it essentially through itself
and is, therefore, self-directed purpose and impulse.
For this very reason, however,
the subject does not possess objectivity immediately in it
(it would then be only the totality of the object as such,
a totality lost in the objectivity)
but is the realization of the purpose,
an objectivity posited by virtue of
the activity of the purpose,
one which, as positedness, has its
subsistence and its form only as
permeated by its subject.
As objectivity, it has the moment of the externality
of the concept in it and is in general,
therefore, the side of finitude,
of alteration and appearance;
but this side retreats into the negative unity of
the concept and there it perishes;
the negativity whereby its indifferent
externality of being manifests itself as unessential
and as a positedness is the concept itself.
Despite this objectivity, the idea is therefore
absolutely simple and immaterial,
for the externality has being only
as determined by the concept
and as taken up into its negativity;
in so far as it exists as indifferent externality,
it is not only abandoned to mechanism in general
but exists only as the transitory and untrue.
Thus although the idea
has its reality in a materiality,
the latter is not an abstract being standing
over against the concept
but, on the contrary, it exists only as becoming,
as simple determinateness of the concept
by virtue of the negativity of the indifferent being.`,
    summary: 'Idea = unity of subjective concept and objectivity. Concept = identity of itself and reality. Reality = determinate being (in particularity/singularity). Objectivity = total concept withdrawn into identity. Subjectivity: determinateness = reflective shine, sublated, negative unity. Objectivity: determinateness = immediate totality, external whole. Idea = concept liberated into subjectivity from object immediacy. Subject-object = formal/subjective concept = object. Absolute judgment: subject = self-referring negative unity, self-directed purpose. Objectivity = realization of purpose, permeated by subject. Externality = finitude/alteration/appearance, retreats into negative unity. Idea = simple/immaterial, externality determined by concept. Materiality = becoming, determinateness of concept.'

    id: 'idea-intro-6-closer-determinations',
    title: 'Closer determinations of the idea',
    text: `This yields the following closer determinations of the idea.

First, the idea is the simple truth,
the identity of concept and objectivity as a
universal in which the opposition,
the presence of the particular,
is dissolved in its self-identical negativity
and is equality with itself.

Second, it is the connection of the subjectivity
of the simple concept, existing for itself,
and of the concept's objectivity which is distinguished from it;
the former is essentially the impulse to sublate this separation,
and the latter is indifferent positedness,
subsistence which in and for itself is null.
As this connection, the idea is
the process of disrupting itself into individuality
and into the latter's inorganic nature,
and of then bringing this inorganic nature again
under the controlling power of the subject
and back to the first simple universality.
The identity of the idea with itself is one with the process;
the thought that liberates actuality from
the seeming of purposeless mutability
and transfigures it into idea
must not represent this truth of actuality
as dead repose, as a mere picture, numb, without impulse and movement,
as a genus or number, or as an abstract thought;
the idea, because of the freedom which the concept has attained in it,
also has the most stubborn opposition within it;
its repose consists in the assurance and the certainty
with which it eternally generates that opposition
and eternally overcomes it, and in it rejoins itself.

But the idea is at first again only immediate or only in its concept;
the objective reality is indeed conformable to the concept
but has not yet been liberated into the concept,
and it does not concretely exist explicitly as the concept.
Thus the concept is indeed the soul,
but the soul is in the guise of an immediate,
that is, it is not determined as soul itself,
has not comprehended itself as soul,
does not have its objective reality within itself;
the concept is as a soul that is not yet fully animated.`,
    summary: 'First: idea = simple truth, identity of concept and objectivity as universal, opposition dissolved, equality with itself. Second: connection of subjectivity (impulse to sublate separation) and objectivity (indifferent positedness, null). Idea = process disrupting into individuality/inorganic nature, bringing under subject control, back to universality. Identity = process. Not dead repose but eternal generation/overcoming of opposition. Idea at first immediate/in concept, objective reality conformable but not liberated, concept = soul not fully animated.'

    id: 'idea-intro-7-three-stages',
    title: 'Three stages: life, cognition, absolute idea',
    text: `Thus the idea is, first of all, life.
It is the concept which, distinct from its objectivity,
simple in itself, permeates that objectivity
and, as self-directed purpose, has its means within it
and posits it as its means, yet is immanent in this means
and is therein the realized purpose identical with itself.
The idea, on account of its immediacy, has singularity
for the form of its concrete existence.
But the reflection within it of its absolute process is
the sublating of this immediate singularity;
thereby the concept, which as universality is
in this singularity the inner,
transforms externality into universality,
or posits its objectivity as a self-equality.

Thus is the idea, in second place,
the idea of the true and the good,
as cognition and will.
It is at first finite cognition and finite will,
where the true and the good are still distinguished
and the two are at first only as a goal.
The concept has first liberated itself into itself,
giving itself only a still abstract objectivity for its reality.
But the process of this finite cognition and this finite action
transforms the initially abstract universality into totality,
whereby it becomes complete objectivity.
Or considered from the other side,
finite, that is, subjective spirit,
makes for itself the
presupposition of an objective world,
such a presupposition as life only has;
but its activity is the sublating of this presupposition
and the turning of it into something posited.
Thus its reality is for it the objective world,
or conversely the objective world is
the ideality in which it knows itself.

Third, spirit recognizes the idea
as its absolute truth,
as the truth that is in and for itself:
the infinite idea in which
cognizing and doing are equalized,
and which is the absolute knowledge of itself.`,
    summary: 'First: idea = life. Concept distinct from objectivity, simple, permeates objectivity, self-directed purpose, means immanent, realized purpose. Immediacy = singularity. Reflection sublates immediate singularity, transforms externality into universality. Second: idea = true and good (cognition and will). Finite cognition/will, true/good distinguished, goal. Concept liberated, abstract objectivity. Process transforms abstract universality into totality = complete objectivity. Finite spirit makes presupposition of objective world, sublates it. Reality = objective world = ideality. Third: spirit recognizes idea as absolute truth, infinite idea, cognizing and doing equalized, absolute knowledge of itself.'
