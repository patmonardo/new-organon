  Chemical Process — B. THE PROCESS

  This module translates the Chemical Process section:
  - Beginning: objects in tension (affinity)
  - Middle term: abstract neutrality (water, language)
  - Communication and neutral product
  - Process dissolution and formal unity
  - Negative unity stepping outside
  - Disruption and disjunctive syllogism
  - Elemental objects and return to beginning

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Beginning: Objects in Tension (Affinity)**:
     Process begins with presupposition that objects in tension, as much as tensed against
     themselves, just as much tensed against each other - relation called affinity. Each
     stands through concept in contradiction to concrete existence's one-sidedness, strives
     to sublate it. Immediately posited: striving to sublate one-sidedness of other, through
     reciprocal balancing and combining, posit reality conformable to concept containing both
     moments. Since each posited as self-contradictory and self-sublating, held apart only by
     external violent force.

  2. **Middle Term: Abstract Neutrality**:
     Middle term whereby extremes concluded into unity is, first, implicitly existent nature
     of both, whole concept containing both. Second, since in concrete existence two stand
     over against each other, absolute unity is formal element concretely existing distinct
     from them - element of communication wherein they enter external community. Since real
     difference belongs to extremes, middle term is abstract neutrality, real possibility of
     extremes, theoretical element of concrete existence, process and result. In realm of
     bodies: water fulfills function of medium. In spirit: sign in general, language more
     specifically, fulfill it.

  3. **Communication and Neutral Product**:
     Relation of objects as mere communication in element is tranquil coming-together but also
     negative relating - in communication concrete concept (their nature) posited in reality,
     real differences reduced to unity. Prior self-subsistent determinateness sublated in union
     conforming to concept (one and same in both). Opposition and tension blunted - striving
     attains tranquil neutrality. Process dissolved - contradiction between concept and reality
     resolved, extremes lost opposition, ceased to be extremes. Product is neutral - ingredients
     no longer objects, no longer in tension, no longer have properties accrued in tension,
     though capacity for prior self-subsistence and tension retained. Negative unity of neutral
     product proceeds from presupposed non-indifference. Determinateness identical with
     objectivity - original. Through process, non-indifference only immediately sublated -
     determinateness not absolutely reflected into itself, product only formal unity.

  4. **Negative Unity Stepping Outside**:
     In product, tension of opposition and negative unity (activity of process) dissolved. But
     since unity essential to concept and has come into concrete existence, still present but
     stepped outside neutral object. Process does not spontaneously re-start - had non-
     indifference only as presupposition, did not posit it. Self-subsistent negativity outside
     object, concrete existence of abstract singularity whose being-for-itself has reality in
     non-indifferent object, is in tension with abstraction - inherently restless activity
     outwardly bent on consuming. Connects immediately with object whose tranquil neutrality
     is real possibility of opposition - same object now middle term of prior formal neutrality,
     now concrete and determined.

  5. **Disruption and Disjunctive Syllogism**:
     Immediate connection of extreme of negative unity with object: latter determined by it,
     disrupted. Disruption may be regarded as restoration of opposition with which chemism began.
     But determination does not constitute other extreme but belongs to immediate connection of
     differentiating principle with middle - determinateness which middle term possesses in
     disjunctive syllogism, whereby object is both objective universality and determinate
     particularity. Other extreme stands opposed to external self-subsistent extreme of
     singularity - equally self-subsisting extreme of universality. Disruption that real
     neutrality undergoes: breaks up into moments not non-indifferent but neutral - abstract
     indifferent base and activating principle (separated, attains form of indifferent
     objectivity). Disjunctive syllogism is totality of chemism - same objective whole
     exhibited as self-standing negative unity, then as real unity (middle term), finally as
     chemical reality resolved into abstract moments. In these moments determinateness has not
     reached immanent reflection in other (as in neutral product) but returned into abstraction,
     originally determined element.

  6. **Elemental Objects and Return**:
     Elemental objects liberated from chemical tension - original basis of presupposition
     posited through real process. Inner determinateness essentially contradiction of simple
     indifferent subsistence and themselves as determinateness - outward impulse that disrupts
     itself, posits tension in determined object and other, so object may have something to
     relate as non-indifferent, neutralize, give simple determinateness existent reality.
     Consequently, on one hand chemism gone back to beginning (objects in reciprocal tension
     seek one another, combine in neutral product by formal external middle term). On other
     hand, by going back to concept, chemism sublates itself, gone over into higher sphere.

  7. **Three Syllogisms of Chemism**:
     Process reveals three syllogisms: (1) Formal neutrality as middle term, objects in
     tension as extremes - neutral product. (2) Real neutrality (product of first) as middle
     term, disrupting activity and indifferent element as extremes - disjunctive syllogism.
     (3) Self-realizing concept positing presupposition - universal essence. These three
     syllogisms constitute totality of chemism, preparing transition to Teleology.

    text: `B. THE PROCESS

1. It begins with the presupposition
that the objects in tension,
as much as they are tensed against themselves,
just as much are they by that very fact
at first tensed against each other,
a relation which is called their affinity.
Each stands through its concept in contradiction
to its concrete existence's own one-sidedness
and each consequently strives to sublate it,
and in this there is immediately posited
the striving to sublate the one-sidedness of the other
and, through this reciprocal balancing and combining,
to posit a reality conformable to the concept
that contains both moments.

Since each is posited within it
as self-contradictory and self-sublating,
they are held apart from each other
and from their reciprocal complementation
only by external violent force.`,
    summary:
      'Process begins: Objects in tension, tensed against themselves and each other - affinity. Each stands through concept in contradiction to one-sidedness, strives to sublate. Immediately posited: striving to sublate one-sidedness of other, through reciprocal balancing posit reality conformable to concept.

    text: `The middle term whereby these extremes are
now concluded into a unity is,
first, the implicitly existent nature of both,
the whole concept containing both within.
But, second, since in concrete existence
the two stand over against each other,
their absolute unity is also a still formal element
that concretely exists distinct from them,
the element of communication wherein they enter
into external community with each other.
Since the real difference belongs to the extremes,
this middle term is only the abstract neutrality,
the real possibility of those extremes,
the theoretical element, as it were,
of the concrete existence of the chemical objects,
of their process and its result.
In the realm of bodies, water fulfills
the function of this medium;
in that of spirit, inasmuch as there is in it
an analog of such a relation,
the sign in general, and language more specifically,
can be regarded as fulfilling it.`,
    summary:
      'Middle term: First, implicitly existent nature of both, whole concept containing both.

    id: 'chem-proc-neutral-product',
    title: 'Communication and neutral product',
    text: `The relation of the objects,
as mere communication in this element,
is on the one hand a tranquil coming-together,
but on the other it is equally a negative relating,
for in communication the concrete concept
which is their nature is posited in reality,
and the real differences of the object are
thereby reduced to its unity.
Their prior self-subsistent determinateness
is thus sublated in the union that conforms to the concept,
which is one and the same in both;
their opposition and tension are thereby blunted,
with the result that in this reciprocal complementation
the striving attains its tranquil neutrality.

The process is in this way dissolved;
since the contradiction between
concept and reality has been resolved,
the extremes of the syllogism have
consequently lost their opposition
and have ceased to be extremes as
against each other and the middle term.
The product is something neutral, that is,
something in which the ingredients,
which can no longer be called objects,
are no longer in tension
and therefore no longer have
the properties that accrued to them in tension,
though in the product the capacity for
their prior self-subsistence and tension is retained.
For the negative unity of the neutral product proceeds
from a presupposed non-indifference;
the determinateness of the chemical object is
identical with its objectivity; it is original.
Through the process just considered,
this non-indifference is only immediately sublated;
the determinateness, therefore, is
not as yet absolutely reflected into itself,
and consequently the product of the process is
only a formal unity.`,
    summary:
      'Communication: Tranquil coming-together but also negative relating - concrete concept posited in reality, real differences reduced to unity. Prior determinateness sublated in union conforming to concept. Opposition and tension blunted - striving attains tranquil neutrality. Process dissolved - contradiction resolved, extremes lost opposition. Product is neutral - ingredients no longer objects, no longer in tension, no properties, though capacity retained. Negative unity proceeds from presupposed non-indifference. Determinateness identical with objectivity - original. Non-indifference only immediately sublated - determinateness not absolutely reflected, product only formal unity.'

    text: `2. In this product the tension of opposition,
and the negative unity which is the activity of the process,
are now indeed dissolved.
But since this unity is essential to the concept
and has also itself come into concrete existence,
it is still present but has stepped outside the neutral object.
The process does not spontaneously re-start itself,
for it had non-indifference only as its presupposition;
it did not posit it.
This self-subsistent negativity outside the object,
the concrete existence of the abstract singularity
whose being-for-itself has its reality in
the non-indifferent object,
is in itself now in tension with its abstraction,
an inherently restless activity outwardly bent on consuming.
It connects immediately with the object
whose tranquil neutrality is the real possibility
of an opposition to this neutrality;
the same object is now the middle term
of the prior formal neutrality,
now concrete in itself and determined.`,

    title: 'Disruption and disjunctive syllogism',
    text: `The more precise immediate connection
of the extreme of negative unity with the object is
in that the latter is determined by it
and is thereby disrupted.
This disruption may at first be regarded
as the restoration of the opposition of the objects
in tension with which chemism began.
But this determination does not constitute
the other extreme of the syllogism
but belongs to the immediate connection
of the differentiating principle
with the middle in which this principle
gives itself its immediate reality;
it is the determinateness which the middle term,
besides at the same time being
the universal nature of the subject matter,
possesses in the disjunctive syllogism,
whereby that object is both
objective universality and determinate particularity.
The other extreme of the syllogism stands opposed to the
external self-subsistent extreme of singularity;
it is, therefore, the equally
self-subsisting extreme of universality;
hence the disruption that the real neutrality
of the middle term undergoes in it is
that it breaks up into moments
that are not non-indifferent
but, on the contrary, neutral.
Accordingly these moments are, on the one side,
the abstract and indifferent base,
and, on the other, this base's activating principle
which, separated from it, equally attains
the form of indifferent objectivity.

This disjunctive syllogism is the totality of chemism
in which the same objective whole is
exhibited as self-standing negative unity;
then, in the middle term, as real unity;
and finally as the chemical reality
resolved into its abstract moments.
In these moments the determinateness has
not reached its immanent reflection in an other
as in the neutral product,
but has in itself returned into its abstraction,
an originally determined element.`,
    summary:
      'Disruption: Object determined by extreme of negative unity, disrupted. May be regarded as restoration of opposition. But determination does not constitute other extreme - belongs to immediate connection of differentiating principle with middle. Middle term possesses determinateness in disjunctive syllogism - object is both objective universality and determinate particularity. Other extreme is self-subsisting extreme of universality. Disruption: real neutrality breaks up into moments not non-indifferent but neutral - abstract indifferent base and activating principle (separated, attains form of indifferent objectivity). Disjunctive syllogism is totality of chemism - same objective whole as negative unity, real unity (middle term), chemical reality resolved into abstract moments. Determinateness returned into abstraction, originally determined element.'

liberated from chemical tension;
in them, the original basis of
that presupposition with which chemism began
has been posited through the real process.
Now further, their inner determinateness is
as such essentially the contradiction
of their simple indifferent subsistence

and posits tension in its determined object
and in an other, in order that the object
may have something to which it can relate as non-indifferent,
with which it can neutralize itself
and give to its simple determinateness an existent reality.
Consequently, on the one hand
chemism has gone back to its beginning
in which objects in a state of reciprocal tension
seek one another and then combine in a neutral product
by means of a formal and external middle term;
and, on the other hand,
by thus going back to its concept,
chemism sublates itself
