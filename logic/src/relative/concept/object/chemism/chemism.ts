  Transition of Chemism — C. TRANSITION OF CHEMISM

  This module translates the Transition of Chemism section:
  - Self-mediation: object posits presupposition for real connection
  - Chemism as first negation of indifferent objectivity
  - Three syllogisms and their falling apart
  - Processes as stages sublatting externality
  - Concept emerging as determined in-and-for-itself
  - Transition to Purpose (Teleology)

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Self-Mediation: Object Posits Presupposition**:
     Even ordinary chemistry shows examples where body imparts higher oxidation to one part,
     reduces another to lower degree, at which degree alone can enter neutral combination
     with another differing body - combination to which would not have been receptive at
     first immediate degree. Object does not connect with another in accordance with immediate
     one-sided determinateness, but in accordance with inner totality of original relation,
     posits presupposition needed for real connection, gives itself middle term by virtue of
     which unites concept with reality in conclusion. Singularity determined in-and-for-itself,
     concrete concept as principle of disjunction into extremes whose re-union is activity of
     same negative principle returning to first determination but objectified.

  2. **Chemism as First Negation**:
     Chemism is first negation of indifferent objectivity and externality of determinateness.
     Still burdened by immediate self-subsistence of object and with externality. Not yet for
     itself that totality of self-determination that proceeds from it and in which it is rather
     sublated. Three syllogisms constitute its totality: (1) Formal neutrality as middle term,
     objects in tension as extremes. (2) Real neutrality (product of first) as middle term,
     disrupting activity and indifferent element as extremes. (3) Self-realizing concept that
     posits for itself presupposition - syllogism with universal for essence.

  3. **Syllogisms Falling Apart**:
     On account of immediacy and externality by which chemical objectivity still determined,
     three syllogisms fall apart. First process extinguished in product, re-activated only by
     differentiation from outside - conditioned by immediate presupposition, exhausted in it.
     Excretion of non-indifferent extremes, decomposition into abstract elements, must proceed
     from conditions and stimulations brought in from outside. Two essential moments (neutralization
     and dissolution/reduction) bound together in same process - union blunting tension is also
     separation - constitute two diverse sides on account of underlying externality. Extremes
     separated are other than objects uniting - as non-indifferent, must turn outwards. Renewed
     neutralization is process other than first.

  4. **Processes as Stages Sublatting Externality**:
     Various processes demonstrated to be necessary are stages by which externality and
     conditionality are sublated, concept emerges as determined in-and-for-itself, totality
     unconditioned by externality. First process: sublated is externality of mutually non-
     indifferent extremes constituting whole reality, or distinction between implicitly determinate
     concept and existing determinateness. Second process: sublated is externality of real unity,
     union as merely neutral. More precisely, formal activity sublates itself in bases equally
     formal, neutral determinacies whose inner concept is absolute activity withdrawn into itself,
     realizes itself internally - posits determinate difference within itself, through mediation
     constitutes itself as real unity. This is concept's own mediation, self-determination,
     immanent presupposing (concept reflects itself back into itself).

  5. **Third Syllogism and Transition to Purpose**:
     Third syllogism, on one hand restoration of preceding processes, on other hand sublates
     last remaining moment of indifferent bases - sublates whole abstract external immediacy
     that becomes concept's own moment of self-mediation. Concept that has sublated as external
     all moments of objective existence, posited them in simple unity, thereby completely
     liberated from objective externality to which refers only as unessential reality. This
     objective free concept is purpose (Teleology).

  6. **Objectivity as Compositions of Syllogism**:
     Transition of Chemism completes second moment of Objectivity - shows how three syllogisms
     of chemism, though falling apart due to externality, progressively sublate externality
     through their necessary processes. Concept emerges as self-determining, self-mediating -
     liberated from externality, becomes Purpose. This prepares Teleology as third and final
     moment of Objectivity - where concept is for itself, self-determining purpose.

    text: `C. TRANSITION OF CHEMISM

Even ordinary chemistry shows examples of
chemical alterations in which a body, for example,
imparts a higher oxidation to one part of its mass
and thereby reduces another part to a lower degree of the same,
at which degree alone it can enter into a neutral combination
with another differing body brought into contact with it,
a combination to which it would not have been receptive
at that other first immediate degree.
What happens here is that the object does not connect
with another in accordance with an immediate, one-sided determinateness,
but, in accordance with the inner totality of an original relation,
posits the presupposition which it needs for a real connection
and thereby gives itself a middle term by virtue of which
it unites its concept with its reality in conclusion;
it is a singularity determined in and for itself,
the concrete concept as the principle of the disjunction
into extremes whose re-union is the activity of
that same negative principle that thereby
returns to its first determination,
but returns to it objectified.`,
    summary:
      'Self-mediation: Chemistry shows body imparts higher oxidation to one part, reduces another to lower degree - at which degree alone can enter neutral combination.

it is still burdened, therefore,

Consequently it is not yet for itself
that totality of self-determination
that proceeds from it
and in which it is rather sublated.
The three syllogisms that have resulted
constitute its totality.
The first has formal neutrality
for its middle term and
for extremes the objects in tension.
The second has for its middle term the
product of the first, real neutrality;
and for extremes the disrupting activity
and its product, the indifferent element.
But the third is the self-realizing concept
that posits for itself the presupposition
by virtue of which the process of its
realization is conditioned:
a syllogism that has the universal for its essence.`,

    text: `Yet, on account of the immediacy and externality
by which the chemical objectivity is still determined,
these three syllogisms fall apart.
The first process whose product is
the neutrality of the tensed objects is
extinguished in this product
and is re-activated only by
a differentiation that comes to it from outside;
conditioned by an immediate presupposition,
the process is exhausted in it.
The excretion out of the neutral product
of the non-indifferent extremes,
as also their decomposition into their abstract elements,
must likewise proceed from conditions and
stimulations of activity brought in from the outside.
But the two essential moments of the process,
neutralization on the one hand
and dissolution and reduction on the other,
since they too are bound together
in one and the same process
and the union blunting the tension of the extremes is
also a separation into these,
constitute on account of the still underlying
externality two diverse sides;
the extremes that are separated in that same process
are other than the objects or matters uniting in it;
in so far as the former proceed from it again
as non-indifferent, they must turn outwards;
their renewed neutralization is a process other
than the one that took place in the first.`,
