  Realized Purpose — C. THE REALIZED PURPOSE

  This module translates the Realized Purpose section:
  - Purpose in connection to means: activity directed against objectivity
  - Connection through means: mechanical/chemical process under dominance
  - Cunning of reason: purpose avoids entering mechanism/chemism directly
  - Means higher than finite purposes: tool example
  - Purpose keeps itself in process: truth of mechanism
  - Content remains identical: teleological process
  - End is beginning: relation determinations lose distinction
  - External purposiveness: infinite progress, only means
  - Truth: inner purposive connection, objective purpose
  - Realized purpose: means disappears, concept identical with objectivity

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Purpose in Connection to Means**:
     Purpose in connection to means already reflected into itself, but objective immanent turning
     back not yet posited. Activity through means still directed against objectivity as initial
     presupposition - activity is to be indifferent to determinateness. If it consisted in
     determining immediate objectivity, product would again be only means, into infinity - only
     purposeful means, not objectivity of purpose itself. Purpose must not determine immediate
     object as external - object must merge in unity of concept through itself. External activity
     must determine itself as mediation, sublate itself as external.

  2. **Connection Through Means: Mechanical/Chemical Process**:
     Connection of activity with external object through means is second premise - immediate
     connection of middle term with other extreme. Immediate because middle term has external
     object within it, other extreme likewise external object. Means effective because linked with
     self-determining activity, whereas other has indifferent determinateness. Process is
     mechanical or chemical - previous relations come up again but under dominance of purpose.
     These processes return into purpose on their own. Connection has exhibited itself as
     syllogism - purpose proved true middle term and unity. Mechanism here is turning back of
     objectivity into itself, into concept (presupposed as purpose). Negative attitude not
     external but objectivity's own alteration, internal transition.

  3. **Cunning of Reason**:
     Purpose immediately referring to object, making it means, determining another object may be
     regarded as violence - purpose appears different nature, objects mutually independent.
     But purpose positing itself in mediate connection, inserting another object between itself
     and object, may be regarded as cunning of reason. Finitude: purpose relates to object as
     presupposition, external. In immediate connection, purpose would enter mechanism/chemism,
     subject to accidentality, loss of vocation to be concept existing in-and-for-itself. By
     sending object as means ahead, lets it do slavish work of externality, abandons to wear
     and tear, preserves itself behind against mechanical violence.

  4. **Means Higher Than Finite Purposes**:
     Purpose finite, has finite content - not rational absolutely. But means is external middle
     term of syllogism which is realization of purpose. In means, rationality in purpose
     manifests by maintaining itself in external other, precisely through externality. To this
     extent means higher than finite purposes of external purposiveness - plough more honorable
     than enjoyments it procures. Tool lasts while immediate enjoyments pass away. In tools
     human beings possess power over external nature, though with respect to purposes subjected
     to it.

  5. **Purpose Keeps Itself in Process: Truth of Mechanism**:
     Purpose does not keep outside mechanical process - keeps itself in it, is its determination.
     Purpose (concept concretely existing freely, self-determining activity) is equally truth
     of mechanism existing in-and-for-itself - in latter only rejoins itself. Power of purpose
     over object is identity existing for itself - activity is manifestation of identity.
     Purpose as content is determinateness existing in-and-for-itself, present in object as
     indifferent and external. Activity of purpose is truth of process, sublation of
     reflective shine of externality. Indifferent determinateness can be replaced abstractly,
     but truth of simple abstraction is totality of negative, concrete concept positing
     externality within itself.

  6. **Content Remains Identical: Teleological Process**:
     Content of purpose is negativity as simple determinateness reflected into itself,
     distinguished from totality as form. On account of simplicity, determinateness (totality
     of concept) appears as that which remains identical in realization. Teleological process is
     translation of concept (concretely existing distinctly as concept) into objectivity.
     Translation into presupposed other is rejoining of concept through itself with itself.
     Content is identity concretely existing in form of identical. In every transition concept
     maintains itself - cause in effect comes to itself. In teleological transition, what
     maintains itself is concept already concretely existing as cause, free concrete unity.
     Externality into which purpose translates itself already posited as moment of concept,
     form of inner differentiation. Purpose has its own moment in externality. Content (simple
     form) does not remain only implicitly equal but exists concretely as abidingly self-equal.

  7. **End is Beginning: Relation Determinations Lose Distinction**:
     Of teleological activity: end is beginning, consequence ground, effect cause - becoming of
     what has become. Only that which already concretely exists comes into existence. All
     relation determinations belonging to sphere of reflection or immediate being have lost
     distinction. What is spoken of as other (end, consequence, effect) no longer has
     determination of other but posited as identical with simple concept.

  8. **External Purposiveness: Infinite Progress**:
     If product examined more closely: purpose comes to it only externally if taken as absolute
     presupposition over against subjective purpose - stopping short at purposive activity
     relating through means only mechanically, positing one indifferent determinateness for
     another external to it. Determinateness through purpose differs from merely mechanical in
     that it is moment of unity - although external, not merely external. Object exhibiting
     unity is whole with respect to which parts (externality) are indifferent - determinate
     concrete unity uniting different connections. Unity cannot be comprehended from specific
     nature of object, of another content - for itself not mechanical determinateness, yet in
     object mechanically. Content of purpose and content of object external to each other.
     Determinations in other moments relate externally. Both premises immediate connection -
     syllogism affected by deficiency of formal syllogism: connections not themselves
     conclusions but presuppose conclusion. Infinite progress: purpose cannot connect
     immediately - means must be interjected, but means equally object determined by purpose,
     new means to be interjected, into infinity. Same with other premise - terms utterly self-
     subsistent, united only in third, into infinity. Conclusion imperfect - product nothing
     but object determined by external purpose, same as means. Only means derived, not realized
     purpose. Entirely indifferent whether considered as realized purpose or means - relative
     determination, external. All objects only means. Means intended for realization - vocation
     to be used up. Object supposed to contain realized purpose is perishable - fulfills
     purpose not by tranquil existence but only worn out, conforms to unity only as externality
     sublates itself. House, clock: stones, beams, wheels fulfill purpose through pressure,
     chemical processes, friction - used up and worn out. Not united positively - self-
     determination only externally, relative purposes, essentially means. Restricted content -
     form infinite self-determination restricted to external singularity. Inadequate to infinity,
     untruth - determinateness at mercy of becoming, passes away.

  9. **External Purposiveness Only Means**:
     Result: external purposiveness (only form of teleology) only goes so far as to be means,
     not objective purpose, because subjective purpose remains external, subjective
     determination. Or insofar as purpose active and attains completion (albeit in means), still
     bound up with objectivity immediately - sunk into it. Purpose itself object - does not
     attain means because realization needed before can be brought about through means.

  10. **Truth: Inner Purposive Connection, Objective Purpose**:
      But result is in fact not only external purposive connection but truth of such connection,
      inner purposive connection and objective purpose. Self-subsistence of object over against
      concept that purpose presupposes is posited in presupposition as unessential reflective
      shine, already sublated in-and-for-itself. Activity of purpose truly is only exposure
      of reflective shine and sublation. First object becomes by virtue of communication a
      means - implicitly totality of concept, determinateness (externality itself) posited
      as only external and unessential, posited in purpose as latter's own moment, not
      standing on its own. Determination of object as means altogether immediate - no need for
      violence, no extra reinforcement. Resolution, determination of itself, is only posited
      externality - object immediately subjected to purpose, has no other determination than
      nothingness of being-in-and-for-itself.

  11. **Second Sublation: Restoration of Objectivity**:
      Second sublating of objectivity through objectivity differs from first: latter is purpose
      in objective immediacy. Second is sublating of both - objective as merely posited and
      immediate. Negativity returns to itself - equally restoration of objectivity, but
      objectivity identical with it. At same time positing it as external objectivity only
      determined by purpose. Because of positing, product remains also means. Because of
      identity with negativity, product is objectivity identical with concept - realized
      purpose in which side of being means is reality itself of purpose. In completed purpose
      means disappears - would be objectivity immediately subsumed under purpose, objectivity
      which in realized purpose is turning back of purpose into itself. Mediation disappears
      - relating of external disappears into concrete identity of objective purpose and same
      identity as abstract identity and immediacy of existence.

  12. **First Sublation Already Second: Doubled Movement**:
      Herein contained mediation required for first premise (immediate connection of purpose
      with object). Realized purpose is also means. Conversely, truth of means is to be real
      purpose itself. First sublation already also second, just as second proved to contain
      first. Concept determines itself - determinateness is external indifference immediately
      determined in resolution as sublated (inner, subjective indifference and presupposed
      object). Further procession (immediate communication and subsumption) is at same time
      sublating of determinateness of externality (internal, shut up in concept, posited as
      sublated) and sublating of presupposition of object. Consequently, apparently first
      sublating of indifferent objectivity is already second - immanent reflection gone
      through mediation, realized purpose.

  13. **Concept in Reciprocal Action: First is Always Second**:
      Concept in sphere of objectivity (determinateness has form of indifferent externality)
      in reciprocal action with itself - exposition doubly difficult, movement immediately
      doubled, first always also second. In concept taken for itself (subjectivity), difference
      of itself from itself is immediate identical totality. But since determinateness here is
      indifferent externality, self-identity in externality immediately also self-repulsion -
      what determined as external and indifferent to identity is rather identity itself, and
      identity as self-reflected is rather its other. Only by firmly attending to this shall
      we comprehend objective turning back of concept into itself (true objectification).
      Every single moment through which mediation runs is itself whole syllogism of mediation.
      Original inner externality (by virtue of which concept is self-repelling unity, purpose,
      striving towards objectivity) is immediate positing/presupposition of external object.
      Self-determination is also determination of external object not determined by concept.
      Conversely, determination is self-determination - sublated externality posited as inner,
      certainty of unessentiality of external object. Second connection (determination of
      object as means) is within itself self-mediation of purpose in object. Third mode
      (mechanism under dominance of purpose, sublates object by virtue of object) is on one
      hand sublating of means (object already posited as sublated) - second sublation and
      immanent reflection. On other hand first determining of external object. This last in
      realized purpose again production of only means - finite concept by rejecting means has
      attained nothing better. But reflection that purpose attained in means, means and
      mediation preserved in fulfilled purpose, is final result of external connection - result
      in which connection sublated itself, exhibited as truth. Third syllogism differs: in first
      instance subjective purposive activity of preceding, but also sublation of external
      objectivity and externality in general - through itself, totality in positedness.

  14. **Final Result: Concept Identical with Objectivity**:
      Subjectivity (being-for-itself) passed over into being-in-itself (objectivity). Negativity
      reasserted itself in objectivity - concept determined itself so that particularity is
      external objectivity, or determined as simple concrete unity whose externality is self-
      determination. Movement of purpose attained: moment of externality not just posited in
      concept, purpose not just ought and striving, but as concrete totality identical with
      immediate objectivity. Identity is on one hand simple concept and equally immediate
      objectivity, but on other hand essentially mediation - simple immediacy only through
      mediation sublating itself as mediation. Concept essentially: to be distinguished (as
      identity existing for itself) from implicitly existent objectivity, thereby obtain
      externality, but in external totality be totality's self-determining identity.

  15. **Objectivity as Compositions of Syllogism**:
      Realized Purpose completes third moment of Objectivity - shows how purpose realizes itself
      through means (Result<M,C>), and how external purposiveness reveals its truth as inner
      purposive connection. Concept becomes identical with immediate objectivity - externality
      is self-determination. This completes Objectivity and prepares transition to Idea (Life,
      Cognition, Absolute Idea) where concept and objectivity are fully united.

1. Purpose is in its connection to the means
already reflected into itself,
but its objective immanent turning back is not yet posited.
The activity of purpose through its means is
still directed against objectivity as
an initial presupposition;
this is precisely what that activity is,
to be indifferent to determinateness.
If it were again to consist in
determining the immediate objectivity,
the product would again be only a means,
and so forth into infinity;
only a purposeful means would result,
but not the objectivity of the purpose itself
In being active in its means, therefore,
purpose must not determine the immediate object as
something external to it,
and the object, accordingly, must merge with it
in the unity of the concept through itself;
or again, the otherwise external activity of purpose
through its means must determine itself as mediation
and thus sublate itself as external.`,

first of all the second premise of the syllogism

It is immediate because the middle term

and the other extreme is likewise an external object.
The means is effective and potent
against this latter object
because its own is linked with
the self-determining activity,
whereas for the other the immediate determinateness
that it possesses is an indifferent one.
Their process in this connection is
none other than the mechanical or chemical one;
the previous relations come up again
in this objective externality,
but under the dominance of purpose.
But these processes, as they themselves showed,
return into purpose on their own.
If, therefore, the connection of the means
to the external object which it has to work upon is
at first an immediate one,
that connection has earlier exhibited
itself already as a syllogism,
for purpose proved to be their
true middle term and unity.
Since the means is therefore the object
that stands on the side of purpose
and has the latter's activity within it,
the mechanism that occurs here is
at the same time the turning back of
objectivity into itself, into the concept
which, however, is already presupposed as purpose;
the negative attitude of the purposeful activity
towards the object is therefore not
an external attitude but, on the contrary,
the objectivity's own alteration

teleological activity more closely,

we stop short at a purposive activity
that relates to the object
through its means only mechanically,
positing in place of one indifferent
determinateness of the object an other
which is just as external to it.
A determinateness such as an object
possesses through purpose differs in
general from one which is merely mechanical
in that it is a moment of
a unity and consequently,
although external to the object,
is yet not in itself
something merely external.
The object that exhibits such a unity is
a whole with respect to which its parts,
its own externality, are indifferent;
it is a determinate, concrete unity that
unites different connections and
determinacies within itself.
This unity, which cannot be comprehended
from the specific nature of the object
and, as regards determinate content,
is of another content than the object's own,
is for itself not a mechanical determinateness,
yet still is in the object mechanically.

external to each other,
so too do the determinations in

the subjective purpose is
syllogistically united with objectivity,
both premises are an immediate connection,

determined as middle term with
the still external object,

 with the object made into means.
The syllogism is therefore affected by
the deficiency of the formal syllogism in general,

in which it consists are not
themselves conclusions or mediations

that of the immediate connection of
the subjective purpose and the object
that thereby becomes a means,
then the purpose cannot
connect with the object immediately,

the object of the other extreme
in which the purpose is to be
realized through mediation.

a means for their connection must be

They fulfill their vocation, therefore,
only through their being used up and worn out,

their form is the infinite self-determination of the concept,

The negativity thus returns to itself in such a way

because it would be simply and solely
the objectivity immediately subsumed under that purpose,
an objectivity which in the realized purpose is
the turning back of the purpose into itself;
further, there also disappears with it mediation itself,

it disappears into both

the determination of an external
object not determined by the concept;
and conversely this determination
is self-determination, that is,
the sublated externality posited as inner,
or the certainty of the unessentiality
of the external object.
Of the second connection,
that of the determination of the object as a means,
we have just shown how it is within itself
the self-mediation of purpose in the object.
Likewise the third mode of connection, mechanism,
which proceeds under the dominance of purpose
and sublates the object by virtue of the object,
is on the one hand the sublating of the means,
of the object already posited as sublated,
and consequently a second sublation

determining of the external object.
This last, as we remarked,
is in the realized purpose
again the production of only a means;
the subjectivity of the finite concept,
by contemptuously rejecting the means,
has attained nothing better in its goal.
But this reflection, namely
that purpose is attained in the means
and that the means and the mediation are
preserved in the fulfilled purpose,
is the final result of
the external connection of purpose,
a result in which this connection has sublated itself
and which it has exhibited as its truth.
The last considered third syllogism differs from the rest
in that it is in the first instance
the subjective purposive activity of the preceding syllogism,

it is this through itself, and is, therefore,
