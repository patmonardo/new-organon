  The Means — B. THE MEANS

  This module translates the Means section:
  - First positing: presupposing objective world
  - Second determining: sublation of presupposition, beginning of realization
  - Means as middle term of syllogism
  - Means as formal middle term, external to extremes
  - Means as mechanical object, externally linked
  - Means as totality: penetrable by purpose
  - Activity through means: no longer mere impulse

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **First and Second Determining**:
     First immediate positing in purpose is positing of something internally determined (determined
     as posited) and at same time presupposing of objective world indifferent to determination
     of purpose. Subjectivity of purpose is absolutely negative unity - its second determining
     is sublation of this presupposition. Sublation is immanent turning back - moment of first
     negation (positing of negative over against subject, external object) is sublated. But as
     against presupposition or immediacy of determining, as against objective world, it is only
     first, itself immediate and hence external negation. This positing not yet realized purpose
     itself but only beginning of realization. Object so determined is means.

  2. **Means as Middle Term**:
     Through means purpose unites with objectivity and in objectivity unites with itself. Means
     is middle term of syllogism. Purpose in need of means for realization because finite - needs
     middle term that has shape of external existence indifferent towards purpose and realization.
     Absolute concept has mediation within itself such that first positing is not presupposition
     in whose object fundamental determination would be indifferent externality - world as creation
     has only form of externality; negativity and positedness constitute fundamental determination.
     Finitude of purpose: determining is external to itself. First determining falls apart into
     supposing and presupposing. Negation of determining: according to one side already immanent
     reflection; according to other side only first negation. Immanent reflection is also self-
     external and reflection outwards.

  3. **Means as Formal Middle Term**:
     Means is formal middle term of formal syllogism - external to extreme of subjective purpose
     and to extreme of objective purpose. Just as particularity in formal syllogism is indifferent
     medius terminus that can be replaced by others. Particularity is middle term by virtue of
     being determinateness with reference to one extreme but universality with reference to other
     - obtains mediating determination by being related to other. So too means is mediating middle
     term only because: first, immediate object; second, means by virtue of reference connecting
     it with extreme of purpose external to it - reference which is for it form to which it is
     indifferent.

  4. **Means as Mechanical Object**:
     Concept and objectivity in means only externally linked - means is merely mechanical object.
     Reference of object to purpose is premise or immediate reference which, with respect to purpose,
     is immanent reflection. Means is inhering predicate - objectivity subsumed under determination
     of purpose (universality on account of concreteness). Through purposive determination present
     in it, means also subsumptive with respect to other extreme (indeterminate objectivity).
     Conversely, as contrasted with subjective purpose, means has as immediate objectivity universality
     of existence which subjective singularity of purpose misses. Since purpose in means only external
     determinateness at first, it is itself (as negative unity) outside means. Means is mechanical
     object possessing purpose only as determinateness, not as simple concretion of totality. But
     as unifying means, middle term must itself be totality of purpose.

  5. **Means as Totality: Penetrable by Purpose**:
     Determination of purpose in middle term is at same time immanent reflection - formal self-reference
     (determinateness posited as real indifference, objectivity of middle term). Precisely for this
     reason subjectivity (pure subjectivity in one respect) is at same time activity. In subjective
     purpose, negative self-reference still identical with determinateness, content, externality.
     But in initial objectification of purpose (becoming-other of simple concept), moments come apart,
     each outside other - becoming-other/externality consists in coming apart. Whole middle term is
     totality of syllogism: abstract activity and external means constitute extremes; determinateness
     of object through purpose (by virtue of which it is means) constitutes middle term. Universality
     is connection of purposiveness and means. Means is object, in itself totality of concept - does
     not have power of resistance against purpose that it initially has against another immediate
     object. To purpose (posited concept), utterly penetrable, receptive because in itself identical.
     Posited that penetrable by concept - in centrality striving towards negative unity; in chemism
     (neutral or non-indifferent) no longer self-subsistent. Non-self-subsistence: being totality
     of concept only implicitly; but concept is being-for-itself. With respect to purpose, object
     powerless, serving - purpose is subjectivity or soul of object that has in latter its external
     side.

  6. **Activity Through Means**:
     Object immediately subjected to purpose is not extreme of syllogism - connection constitutes
     premise. But means has one side from which still has self-subsistence as against purpose.
     Objectivity in means bound with purpose still external to it because only immediately connected -
     presupposition still persists. Activity of purpose through means still directed against presupposition.
     Purpose is activity, no longer mere impulse and striving, because in means moment of objectivity
     posited in determinateness as external, and simple unity of concept now has objectivity as such
     within it.

  7. **Pipeline Structure**:
     Means shows how purpose realizes itself through mechanical and chemical objects (Result<M,C>).
     Purpose uses means (mechanical object) to penetrate and transform objective world. Means is
     middle term connecting subjective purpose with objective purpose - preparing for Realized
     Purpose where purpose achieves its end.

    text: `B. THE MEANS

The first immediate positing in purpose is
equally the positing of something internally determined,
that is, determined as posited, and, at the same time,
the presupposing of an objective world,
one indifferent to the determination of purpose.
But the subjectivity of purpose is
the absolutely negative unity;
its second determining is, therefore,
the sublation of this presupposition as such;
this sublation is an immanent turning back
inasmuch as that moment of the first negation
which is the positing of the negative over against the subject,
the external object, is sublated by it.
But as against the presupposition
or the immediacy of the determining,
as against the objective world,
it is as yet only the first,
itself immediate and hence external negation.
This positing is therefore not yet
the realized purpose itself
but only the beginning of this realization.
The object so determined is now the means.`,

This means is the middle term of the syllogism.
Purpose is in need of a means for its realization,
because it is finite, in need of a means,
that is to say, of a middle term
that has at the same time the shape of an
external existence indifferent towards
the purpose itself and its realization.
The absolute concept has mediation
within itself in such a manner that
the first positing of it is not a
presupposition in whose object
the fundamental determination
would be an indifferent externality;
on the contrary, the world as creation has
only the form of such an externality;
it is its negativity and the positedness
that rather constitute its fundamental determination.
Accordingly, the finitude of purpose consists in this,
that its determining is as such external to itself;
accordingly, its first determining, as we have seen,
falls apart into a supposing and a presupposing;
the negation of this determining is therefore
only according to one side already immanent reflection;
according to the other side, it is rather only first negation.
Or again, the immanent reflection is itself also self-external

Moreover, just as this particularity is
a middle term by virtue of being
determinateness with reference to one extreme

and therefore obtains its mediating determination
by being related to an other,
so too the means is a mediating middle term
only because it is,
first, an immediate object,

a premise or the immediate reference

is with respect to purpose an immanent reflection;
the means is an inhering predicate;
its objectivity is subsumed under
the determination of purpose which,
on account of its concreteness, is universality.
Through this purposive determination present in it,
the means is now also subsumptive
with respect to the other extreme,
the at the moment still indeterminate objectivity.
Conversely, as contrasted with the subjective purpose,
the means has as immediate objectivity a universality of
existence which the subjective singularity of purpose still misses.
Thus, since purpose is in the means as
only an external determinateness at first,
it is itself, as the negative unity, outside the means;
the means, for its part, is a mechanical object
that possesses purpose only as a determinateness,
not as the simple concretion of totality.

the middle term must itself be
the totality of the purpose.`,

    id: 'tel-means-totality',
    title: 'Means as totality: penetrable by purpose',
    text: `It has been shown that the
determination of purpose is in the middle term
at the same time immanent reflection;
as this reflection, it is a formal self-reference,
since the determinateness is posited as real indifference,
as the objectivity of the middle term.
But precisely for this reason this subjectivity,
which is in one respect pure subjectivity,
is at the same time also activity.
In the subjective purpose the
negative self-reference is
still identical with determinateness as such,
with the content and the externality.
However, in the initial objectification of purpose
which is a becoming-other of the simple concept,
those moments come apart, each outside the other,
or, conversely, the becoming-other
or the externality itself consists in this coming apart.

This whole middle term is thus
the totality of the syllogism
in which the abstract activity
and the external means
constitute the extremes,
while the determinateness of
the object through the purpose,
by virtue of which it is a means,
constitutes the middle term.
But further, universality is
the connection of purposiveness and the means.
This means is object,
in itself the totality of the concept;
it does not have with respect to purpose
any of the power of resistance
that it initially has against
another immediate object.
To the purpose, therefore,
which is the posited concept,
it is utterly penetrable,
and it is receptive to this communication
because it is in itself identical with it.
But it is now also posited that
it is penetrable by the concept,
for in centrality it is an object
striving towards negative unity;
in chemism, too, whether as neutral or non-indifferent,
it is no longer self-subsistent.
Its non-self-subsistence consists
precisely in its being the
totality of the concept only implicitly;
but the concept is being-for-itself.
Consequently, with respect to purpose
the object has the character of being
powerless and of serving it;
purpose is the subjectivity or soul of the object
that has in the latter its external side.`,
    summary:
      'Totality: Determination of purpose in middle term is immanent reflection - formal self-reference (determinateness as real indifference, objectivity). Subjectivity is also activity. In subjective purpose, negative self-reference identical with determinateness, content, externality.
