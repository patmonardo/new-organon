  Subjective Purpose — A. THE SUBJECTIVE PURPOSE

  This module translates the Subjective Purpose section:
  - Purpose as synthesis of Mechanism and Chemism (Result<M,C>)
  - Concept rediscovered in objectivity: centrality (M) and chemism (C)
  - Purpose as essential striving to posit itself externally
  - Exempt from transition: not force, substance, or cause
  - Purpose as rational in concrete existence
  - Syllogistic structure: universal → particularity → singularity
  - Finitude: presupposition of mechanical and chemical world
  - Movement: sublating presupposition, realizing purpose

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Purpose as Synthesis of Mechanism and Chemism (Result<M,C>)**:
     In centrality of objective sphere (indifference to determinateness - Mechanism), subjective
     concept has first rediscovered and posited negative point of unity. In chemism, it has
     first rediscovered and posited objectivity of determinations of concept by which it is
     first posited as concrete objective concept. Purpose synthesizes these: Mechanism (center,
     law) and Chemism (non-indifference, tension) → Purpose (self-determining, self-mediating).
     Pipeline: Object(M) → Process(M) → Object(C) → Process(C) → Telos (Purpose).

  2. **Purpose as Essential Striving**:
     Determinateness or simple difference now has determinateness of externality within it.
     Simple unity is unity that repels itself from itself and in repelling maintains itself.
     Purpose is subjective concept as essential striving and impulse to posit itself externally.
     In this, exempt from transition. Not force expressing itself (has to be solicited), not
     substance or cause manifesting in accidents/effects (activity is transition against which
     they do not maintain themselves in freedom). Purpose can be defined as force or cause, but
     only in way that sublates their concept - cause that solicits itself, cause of itself,
     effect immediately the cause.

  3. **Purpose as Rational in Concrete Existence**:
     When purposiveness attributed to intelligence, done with specific reference to content.
     But as such, purpose is rational in concrete existence. Manifests rationality by being
     concrete concept that holds objective difference in absolute unity. Within, essentially
     syllogism. Self-equal universal - more precisely, contains self-repelling negativity,
     universal though at first still indeterminate activity. Since activity is negative self-
     reference, determines itself immediately, gives itself moment of particularity. This
     particularity, as totality of form reflected into itself, is content as against posited
     differences of form. Same negativity, through self-reference, is reflection of form into
     itself and singularity. From one side: inner universality of subject. From other side:
     outwards reflection. To this extent purpose still subjective, activity directed to
     external objectivity.

  4. **Purpose as Concept Come to Itself in Objectivity**:
     Purpose is concept that has come to itself in objectivity. Determinateness it has given
     itself is that of objective indifference and externality of determinateness. Self-repelling
     negativity is one whose moments, being only determinations of concept itself, also have
     form of objective indifference to one another. Already in formal judgment, subject and
     predicate determined as self-subsistent over against each other - but self-subsistence still
     only abstract universality. Now attained determination of objectivity, but as moment of
     concept, complete difference enclosed within simple unity of concept.

  5. **Finitude of Purpose**:
     Purpose is total reflection of objectivity into itself, immediately. First: self-determination
     or particularity as simple reflection into itself distinguished from concrete form, is
     determinate content. Accordingly, purpose is finite, even though according to form equally
     infinite subjectivity. Second: since determinateness has form of objective indifference,
     has shape of presupposition. Finitude consists in having before it objective, mechanical
     and chemical world to which activity directed as to something already there. Self-determining
     activity in its identity immediately external to itself - reflection into itself just as
     much as reflection outwards. Purpose still has extra-mundane concrete existence - objectivity
     stands opposed to it, mechanical and chemical whole still not determined and not pervaded
     by purpose, stands opposed.

  6. **Movement of Purpose: Realization**:
     Movement of purpose directed at sublating presupposition (immediacy of object), positing
     it as determined by concept. Negative relating to object equally negative attitude towards
     itself - sublating subjectivity of purpose. Positively, realization of purpose - unification
     of objective being with it, so that being (as moment of purpose, immediately determinateness
     identical with it) shall be as external determinateness, and conversely objective (as
     presupposition) shall be posited as determined by concept.

  7. **Purpose as Impulse to Realization**:
     Purpose is impulse to realization. Determinateness of moments of concept is externality.
     Simplicity of moments within unity of concept incommensurable with what unity is - concept
     repels itself from itself. Repulsion is resolution of self-reference of negative unity
     (exclusive singularity) - by excluding, unity resolves itself, discloses itself, for it
     is self-determination, positing of itself. In determining itself, subjectivity makes itself
     into particularity, gives itself content (enclosed within unity, still inner content). But
     positing (simple reflection into itself) is immediately presupposing. At same moment subject
     determines itself, referred to indifferent external objectivity which is to be made equal
     with determinateness of inner content - posited as determined by concept, first of all as
     means.

In the centrality of the objective sphere,
which is an indifference to determinateness,
the subjective concept has first rediscovered
and posited the negative point of unity,

and posited the objectivity of the determinations
of the concept by which it is first posited
as concrete objective concept.
Its determinateness or its simple difference now
has the determinateness of externality within it,
and its simple unity is therefore
the unity that repels itself from itself
and in this repelling maintains itself.
Purpose, therefore, is the subjective concept as
an essential striving and impulse
to posit itself externally.
In this, it is exempt from transition.`,

this can be done only in a way that sublates their concept,

a sublating of the subjectivity of purpose.
Positively, this is the realization of purpose,

subjectivity makes itself into particularity,
