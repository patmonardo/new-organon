  Mechanical Process — B. THE MECHANICAL PROCESS

  This module translates the Mechanical Process section:
  - Critique of monads: deficient reflection
  - Transition to objectivity: causal relation ended in concept
  - Mechanism as posited causality: cause is also effect
  - Formal process: Communication → Reaction → Product (Rest)
  - Real process: Strength difference → Power/Violence → Fate
  - Product: Center → Law → Foundation

  PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES:

  1. **Critique of Monads**:
     If objects regarded as self-enclosed totalities, cannot act on one another - same as
     monads. But concept of monad is deficient reflection. First: monad is determinate
     representation but indifferent to determinateness - not own but posited through another.
     Second: immediate in general, just mirroring - abstract universality, existence open
     to others. Self-reference that is only mirroring is passivity towards other.
     Determinateness is external - degree has limit in other. Predetermined harmony removes
     from scope of concept. Positedness does not correspond to assumed in-itselfness - has
     ground in other.

  2. **Transition to Objectivity**:
     Existent no longer has determination of substance but of object. Causal relation has
     come to an end in concept. Originariness shown to be reflective shine - substance's
     action transition into opposite. This relation has no objectivity. Object posited as
     efficient cause no longer originary but mediated - active object has determination only
     by means of another object.

  3. **Mechanism as Posited Causality**:
     Mechanism belongs to sphere of concept - has posited within it truth of causality:
     cause supposed to be existing in-and-for-itself is in fact effect, positedness.
     In mechanism, originary causality is immediately non-originariness. Object indifferent
     to determination - that it is cause is accidental. Causality of substances is product
     of representation - precisely this is mechanism. Causality as identical determinateness
     of diversity of substances, foundering into identity of self-subsistence, is mere
     positedness. Objects indifferent to unity, maintain themselves. But indifferent
     self-subsistence is also mere positedness - objects capable of mixing, aggregating,
     becoming one object. Through indifference to transition and self-subsistence, substances
     are objects.

  4. **Formal Mechanical Process: Communication**:
     Mechanical process is positing of contradiction contained in concept of mechanism.
     Interaction of objects is positing of identical connection - giving determinateness
     form of universality. This is communication, occurs without transition into opposite.
     Spiritual communication: idealized connection, determinateness continues undisturbed,
     generalizing unaltered, like scent spreading in unresisting atmosphere. Material
     communication: determinateness widens in equally idealizing manner. Personality is
     infinitely more intensive hardness than objects. Formal totality renders object
     indistinct from another - unimpeded continuing of determinateness. In spirit: manifold
     content capable of communication - taken up into intelligence receives form of
     universality. Universal in-and-for-itself is objective as such - laws, morals, rational
     conceptions (spirit); motion, heat, magnetism, electricity (body). These are
     imponderable agents - lack aspect of materiality grounding singularization.

  5. **Formal Process: Reaction**:
     Although identical universality posited first, equally necessary to posit particularity.
     Objects demonstrate self-subsistence - hold themselves outside each other, produce
     singularity in universality. This production is reaction. Reaction not mere sublation
     of action - communicated is universal positively present, particularizes in diversity.
     Communicated remains what it is, distributed among objects. Active object becomes
     universal - action is particularization, object becomes species, determinateness posited
     as universal. Raising singular into universality and particularization in distribution
     are one and same. Reaction equals action: other object takes over entire universal,
     now active against first - reciprocal repulsion. Communicated is objective - remains
     substantial determination, universal specifies itself, each object has specific share.
     Third: reaction is wholly negative action - elasticity of self-subsistence repels
     positedness of other, retains self-reference. Particularity returns to singularity,
     object asserts externality. Action passes over into rest - superficial, transient
     alteration within self-enclosed indifferent totality.

  6. **Formal Process: Product**:
     Return constitutes product. Object presupposed as singular → particular → universal
     (indifferent to particularity). Product is totality of concept previously presupposed
     but now posited. Conclusion: communicated universal united with singularity through
     particularity. In rest, mediation posited as sublated - product indifferent to
     determining, received determinateness external. Product same as object that first
     enters process, but first determined through movement. Mechanical object is object only
     as product - what it is only by virtue of mediation of other. As product it is what
     supposed to be in-and-for-itself - composite, mixture, arrangement. Determinateness
     not self-determination but posited. Result not already there ahead - end not in
     beginning (unlike purpose). Product is determinateness externally posited. According
     to concept same as beginning, but external determinateness not yet there as posited.
     Result quite other than first existence - utterly accidental.

  7. **Real Mechanical Process**:
     Process passes over into rest - determinateness only external. Rest also external.
     Since determinateness is posited, concept gone back to itself, object contains
     determinateness as reflected into itself. Objects and process have more closely
     determined relation - determinedly differentiated. Result: on one hand determinationless
     rest, on other hand distribution among several objects of opposition in object as such.
     Object lacks all determination (no elasticity) but has impenetrable self-subsistence.
     Objects have more determined opposition: self-subsistent singularity vs non-self-
     subsistent universality. Difference may be quantitative (mass, intensity). Both
     positively self-subsistent.

  8. **Real Process: Communication and Resistance**:
     First moment is communication. Weaker seized by stronger only insofar as accepts stronger,
     constitutes one sphere. Weaker secured against disproportionately strong (sheet not
     penetrated by musket ball; weak organic receptivity not vulnerable to strong stimuli).
     Wholly feeble spirit safer facing strong than one closer. Dull-witted, ignoble - lofty
     intelligence makes no impression. Defense against reason: not get involved. Object
     with no standing unable to make contact - no communication, no resistance. If not in
     same sphere, connection would be infinite judgment, no process possible. Resistance is
     moment of overpowering - initial moment in distribution of communicated universal,
     positing self-referring negativity (singularity). Resistance overpowered when
     determinateness not commensurate to communicated universal - singularity lacks capacity,
     shattered, unable to constitute itself as subject, cannot make universal its predicate.

  9. **Power and Violence**:
     Violence against object is alien only according to second aspect. Power becomes violence
     when power (objective universality) identical with nature of object, yet determinateness/
     negativity not object's own immanent negative reflection (according to which object is
     singular). Negativity not reflected back into itself in power, power not object's own
     self-reference - negativity is abstract negativity, manifestation is extinction.

  10. **Fate**:
      Power as objective universality and violence against object is fate. Concept falls
      within mechanism insofar as fate called blind - objective universality not recognized
      by subject in own specific sphere. Fate of living thing is genus - manifests through
      fleetingness of individuals that do not possess it as genus in actual singularity.
      Merely animate natures do not have fate - what befalls them is contingency. In concept
      as objects they are self-external - alien power of fate is their own immediate nature,
      externality and contingency. Only self-consciousness has fate in strict sense - free,
      in singularity of "I" absolutely exists in-and-for-itself, can oppose objective
      universality, alienate from it. By separation, excites mechanical relation of fate.
      To have violent power over it, must have given itself determinateness over against
      essential universality - must have committed deed. Self-consciousness made itself into
      particular - existence open to communication of alienated essence, drawn into process.
      People without deeds is without blame - wrapped up in objective ethical universality,
      dissolved into it, without individuality that moves unmoved, gives determinateness
      outside, abstract universality separated from objective universality. In individuality,
      subject divested of essence, becomes object, enters relation of externality - mechanism.

  11. **Product: Center and Law**:
      Product of formal mechanism is object in general, indifferent totality with determinateness
      as posited. Result: on one hand rest (original formalism, negativity of determinateness-
      for-itself), on other hand sublation of determinateness, positive reflection into itself,
      determinateness withdrawn into itself, posited totality of concept, true singularity.
      Object determined as objective singular - reflective semblance of singularity (self-
      subsistence opposing substantial universality) sublated. Resulting immanent reflection,
      objective oneness, is individual self-subsistence: the center. Reflection of negativity
      is universality not fate standing over determinateness but rational fate, immanently
      determined, universality particularizing from within, difference remaining at rest and
      fixed in unstable particularity: the law. This result is truth and foundation of
      mechanical process.

  12. **Objectivity as Compositions of Syllogism**:
      Mechanical Process shows Objectivity as composition of syllogism - not simple thing
      but systematic composition. Pattern: Object → Process (Communication-Reaction-Rest) →
      Mechanism (Center-Law-Foundation). This is first composition - formal and real process
      revealing concept structure underlying apparent externality. Center and Law emerge as
      truth of mechanism - preparing for Chemism as higher objective form.

    title: 'Critique of monads: deficient reflection',
    text: `B. THE MECHANICAL PROCESS

If objects are regarded only as self-enclosed totalities,
they cannot act on one another.
Regarded in this way, they are the same as the monads
which, precisely for that reason, were thought of
as having no influence on each other.
But the concept of a monad is for just this reason
a deficient reflection.
For, in the first place, the monad is
a determinate representation of its only implicit totality;
as a certain degree of development and positedness of its
representation of the world, it is determinate;
but since it is a self-enclosed totality,
it is also indifferent to this determinateness
and is, therefore, not its own determinateness
but a determinateness posited through another object.
In second place, it is an immediate in general,
for it is supposed to be just a mirroring;
its self-reference is therefore abstract universality
and hence an existence open to others.
It does not suffice, in order to gain the freedom of substance,
to represent the latter as a totality that,
complete in itself, would have nothing to receive from the outside.
On the contrary, a self-reference that grasps nothing conceptually
but is only a mirroring is precisely a passivity towards the other.
Likewise the determinateness, whether we now take it as
the determinateness of a being that exists or that mirrors,
as a degree of the monad's own internally generated development,
is something external;
the degree that the development achieves has its limit in an other.
To project the reciprocal influence of substances
into a predetermined harmony means nothing more
than to make it a presupposition,
in effect to remove it from the scope of the concept.
The need to avoid the interaction of substances was founded
on the moment of absolute self-subsistence
and originariness which was made a fundamental assumption.
But since the positedness, the degree of development,
does not correspond to this assumed in-itselfness,
it has for this reason its ground in an other.`,
    summary:
      'Monad critique: Objects as self-enclosed totalities cannot act on one another - same as monads. But monad concept is deficient reflection. First: determinate representation but indifferent to determinateness - not own but posited through another. Second: immediate, just mirroring - abstract universality, passivity. Determinateness is external - degree has limit in other. Predetermined harmony removes from concept. Positedness does not correspond to in-itselfness - has ground in other.'

    title: 'Transition to objectivity: mechanism as posited causality',
    text: `In connection with the relation of substantiality,
we showed that it passes over into the relation of causality.
But now the existent no longer has the
determination of a substance but that of an object;
the causal relation has come to an end in the concept;
the originariness of one substance vis-à-vis another
has shown itself to be a reflective shine,
the substance's action a transition into the opposite substance.
This relation has therefore no objectivity.
Hence in so far as one object is posited
in the form of subjective unity, as efficient cause,
this no longer counts as an originary determination
but as something mediated;
the active object has this determination
only by means of another object.
Mechanism, since it belongs to the sphere of the concept,
has that posited within it which proved to be
the truth of the relation of causality, namely,
that the cause which is supposed to be something
existing in and for itself is in fact
effect just as well, positedness.
In mechanism, therefore,
the originary causality of the object is
immediately a non-originariness;
the object is indifferent to this
determination attributed to it;
that it is a cause is therefore
something accidental to it.
To this extent, it can be said
that the causality of substances is
only the product of representation.
But precisely this causality
as product of representation
is what mechanism is;
for mechanism is this,
that causality,
as identical determinateness of
a diversity of substances
and hence as the foundering into
this identity of their self-subsistence,
is mere positedness;
the objects are indifferent to this unity
and maintain themselves in the face of it.
But this also, their indifferent self-subsistence,
is a mere positedness,
and for this reason they are capable of
mixing and aggregating,
and as an aggregate of becoming one object.
Through this indifference both
to their transition and to their self-subsistence,
the substances are objects.`,
    summary:
      'Transition: Existent no longer substance but object. Causal relation ended in concept - originariness is reflective shine. Object as efficient cause no longer originary but mediated. Mechanism has posited within it truth of causality: cause is also effect, positedness. Originary causality is non-originariness - object indifferent, cause is accidental. Causality is product of representation - precisely this is mechanism. Causality as identical determinateness, foundering into identity, is mere positedness. Objects indifferent to unity, maintain themselves. But indifferent self-subsistence is also positedness - objects capable of mixing, aggregating, becoming one object.

    id: 'mech-proc-communication',
    title: 'Communication: universal spreading without opposition',
    text: `1. It follows from the just indicated concept
that the interaction of objects is
the positing of their identical connection.
This positing consists simply in giving to
the determinateness which is generated
the form of universality and this is communication,
which occurs without transition into the opposite.
Spiritual communication, which however takes place in
an element of universality in the form of universality,
is an idealized connection for itself,
one in which a determinateness continues undisturbed from
one person to another, generalizing itself unaltered,
like a scent freely spreading in the unresisting atmosphere.
But also in the communication between material objects
does their determinateness widen, so to speak,
in an equally idealizing manner;
personality is an infinitely more
intensive hardness than objects possess.
The formal totality of an object in general,
a totality indifferent to determinateness
and hence not a self-determination,
renders the object indistinct from another object
and thus makes interaction at first an unimpeded continuing
of the determinateness of the one into the other.

Now in the region of the spirit there is
an infinitely manifold content capable of communication,
for by being taken up into intelligence the content receives
this form of universality in which it becomes communicable.
But that which is a universal not only by virtue of form,
but in and for itself, is the objective as such,
both in the region of the spirit and of the body,
and as against it the singularity of
external objects, as of persons also,
is an unessential factor unable to offer
any resistance to it.
Laws, morals, rational conceptions in general,
are in the region of the spirit communicable entities of this kind;
they pervade individuals unconsciously imposing themselves on them.
In the region of the body, such entities are
motion, heat, magnetism, electricity, and the like,
all of which, even when one wants to imagine them
as stuffs or materials,
must be termed as imponderable agents,
for they lack that aspect of materiality
that grounds its singularization.`,

    text: `2. Now although in the interaction of objects
their identical universality is posited first,
it is equally necessary to posit
the other moment of the concept,
that of particularity;
the objects thus also demonstrate their self-subsistence;
they hold themselves outside each other,
and in that universality they produce singularity.
This production is reaction in general.
To begin with, this reaction is not to be conceived of
as a mere sublation of action
and of the communicated determinateness;
what is communicated is as
universal positively present in the particular objects
and particularizes itself only in their diversity.
To this extent, therefore, what is communicated
remains what it is, only distributed among
the objects or determined by their particularity.
the activity of the causal substance in its action;
but the active object only becomes a universal;
its action is from the start not a loss of its determinateness
but a particularization by virtue of which the object,
which was at first that whole determinateness present in it as single,
now becomes a species of it,
and the determinateness is thereby posited
for the first time as a universal.
The two, the raising in communication of
the singular determinateness into universality;
and the particularization of it in distribution,
the reduction of what was only a one to a species
are one and the same.

Now reaction is equal to action.
First, this is manifested by the other object
taking over the entire universal;
and so it is now active against the first.
Thus its reaction is the same as the action,
a reciprocal repulsion of the impulse.
Second, what is communicated is the objective;
it therefore remains the substantial determination of
the object on the presupposition of their diversity;
the universal thus at the same time specifies itself in them,
and consequently each object does not simply give back
the whole action but possesses its specific share.
But, third, reaction is a wholly negative action
in so far as each object,
because of the elasticity of its self-subsistence,
repels within it the positedness of an other
and retains its self-reference.
The specific particularity of the determinateness
communicated in the objects,
what was before called species,
returns to singularity,
and the object asserts its externality
as against the communicated universality.
The action thereby passes over into rest.
It proves to be only a superficial,
transient alteration within the self-enclosed
indifferent totality of the object.`,
    summary:
      'Reaction: Equally necessary to posit particularity. Objects demonstrate self-subsistence - hold themselves outside, produce singularity. Reaction not mere sublation - communicated is universal positively present, particularizes in diversity. Active object becomes universal - action is particularization, becomes species, determinateness posited as universal. Raising singular into universality and particularization are one and same. Reaction equals action: other takes over universal, active against first - reciprocal repulsion. Communicated is objective - remains substantial, universal specifies, each has specific share. Third: reaction is negative action - elasticity repels positedness of other, retains self-reference. Particularity returns to singularity, object asserts externality.

    id: 'mech-proc-product-formal',
    title: 'Product of formal process: return to rest',
    text: `3. This return constitutes the product of the mechanical process.
Immediately, the object is presupposed as a singular
then as a particular as against another particular;
but finally as indifferent towards its particularity,
as universal.
The product is the totality of the concept
previously presupposed but now posited.
It is the conclusion in which the communicated universal
is united with singularity through the particularity of the object.
In rest, however, the mediation is posited
at the same time as sublated;
or again, what is posited is
that the product is indifferent to this determining of it
and that the received determinateness is external in it.

Accordingly the product is the same as the object
that first enters the process.
But at the same time that object is
first determined through this movement;
the mechanical object is, as such,
an object only as product,
for what it is, is only by virtue of
the mediation of an other in it.
It is as product that it thus is
what it was supposed to be in and for itself,
a composite, a mixture, a certain arrangement of parts,
in general such that its determinateness is
not self-determination but something posited.

Yet the result of the mechanical process is
not already there ahead of that process itself;
its end is not in its beginning, as in the case of purpose.
The product is in the object a determinateness
which is externally posited in it.
Hence this product is indeed
according to its concept the same as
what the object already is at the beginning.
But at the beginning the external determinateness is
not yet there as posited.
The result is therefore something
quite other than the first existence of the object,

    text: `b. The real mechanical process

The mechanical process passes over into rest.
That is to say, the determinateness that the object obtains
through that process is only an external one.
Just as external to it is this rest,
for although the latter is a determinateness
opposed to the activity of the object,
the two are each indifferent to the object.
Rest can also be viewed, therefore,
as brought about by an external cause,
just as much as it was indifferent to
the object to be active.
Now further, since the determinateness is a posited one,
and the concept of the object has gone back to itself
through the process of mediation,
the object contains the determinateness
as one that is reflected into itself.
Hence in the mechanical process the objects
and the process itself now
have a more closely determined relation.
They are not merely diverse,
but are determinedly differentiated as against one another.
Consequently the result of the formal process,
on the one hand a determinationless rest, is,
on the other hand, through
the immanently reflected determinateness,
the distribution among several objects
mechanically relating to one another
of the opposition which is in the object as such.
The object that on the one hand lacks all determination,
showing no elasticity and no self-subsistence in its relations,
has, on the other hand, a self-subsistence
impenetrable to other objects.
Objects now have also as against one another
this more determined opposition of
the self-subsistent singularity
and the non-self-subsistent universality.
The precise difference between any two may be
had merely quantitatively as a difference in
a body of diverse magnitudes of mass,
or of intensity, or in various other ways.
But in general the difference cannot be fixed
at just this abstract level;
also as objects, both are
positively self-subsistent.`,

they are self-external;
hence the alien power of fate is
simply and solely their own immediate nature,
externality and contingency itself.
Only self-consciousness has fate in a strict sense,
because it is free,
and therefore in the singularity of its "I"
it absolutely exists in and for itself
and can oppose itself to its objective universality
and alienate itself from it.
By this separation, however, it excites against itself
the mechanical relation of a fate.
Hence, for the latter to have violent power over it,
it must have given itself some determinateness or other
over against the essential universality;
it must have committed a deed.
Self-consciousness has thereby made itself into a particular,
and this existence, like abstract universality,
is at the same time the side open to
the communication of its alienated essence;
it is from this side that it is
drawn into the process.
A people without deeds is without blame;
it is wrapped up in objective, ethical universality,
is dissolved into it,
is without the individuality
that moves the unmoved,
that gives itself a determinateness on the outside
and an abstract universality separated
from the objective universality;
yet in this individuality the subject is also
divested of its essence,
becomes an object and enters into the relation of
externality towards its nature,
into that of mechanism.`,
    summary:
      'Fate: Power as objective universality and violence is fate. Falls within mechanism insofar as fate called blind - objective universality not recognized by subject. Fate of living thing is genus - manifests through fleetingness of individuals that do not possess it as genus in actual singularity. Merely animate natures do not have fate - what befalls is contingency. In concept as objects they are self-external - alien power of fate is their own immediate nature, externality and contingency. Only self-consciousness has fate in strict sense - free, in singularity of "I" absolutely exists, can oppose objective universality, alienate. By separation, excites mechanical relation of fate. To have violent power, must have given determinateness over against essential universality - must have committed deed. Made itself into particular - existence open to communication of alienated essence, drawn into process. People without deeds is without blame - wrapped up in objective ethical universality, dissolved, without individuality. In individuality, subject divested of essence, becomes object, enters externality - mechanism.'

    text: `c. The product of the mechanical process

The product of formal mechanism is
the object in general,
an indifferent totality
in which determinateness is as posited.
The object has hereby entered
the process as a determinate thing,
and, in the extinction of this process,
the result is, on the one hand, rest,
the original formalism of the object,
the negativity of its determinateness-for-itself.
But, on the other hand, it is
the sublation of the determinateness,
the positive reflection of it into itself,
the determinateness that has withdrawn into itself,
or the posited totality of the concept,
the true singularity of the object.
The object, determined at first
in its indeterminate universality,
then as particular, is now
determined as an objective singular,
so that in it that reflective semblance of singularity,
which is only a self-subsistence opposing itself
to the substantial universality,
is sublated.

This resulting immanent reflection,
the objective oneness of the objects,
is now a oneness which is an individual self-subsistence:
the center.

Secondly, the reflection of negativity is
the universality which is not a fate
standing over against determinateness,
but a rational fate, immanently determined,
a universality that particularizes itself from within,
the difference that remains at rest and fixed
in the unstable particularity of the objects
and their process;
it is the law.

This result is the truth,
and consequently also the foundation,
of the mechanical process.`,
    summary:
      'Product: Product of formal mechanism is object in general, indifferent totality with determinateness as posited. Result: on one hand rest (original formalism, negativity of determinateness-for-itself), on other hand sublation of determinateness, positive reflection into itself, determinateness withdrawn, posited totality of concept, true singularity. Object determined as objective singular - reflective semblance of singularity (self-subsistence opposing substantial universality) sublated. Resulting immanent reflection, objective oneness, is individual self-subsistence: the center. Reflection of negativity is universality not fate standing over determinateness but rational fate, immanently determined, universality particularizing from within, difference remaining at rest and fixed: the law. This result is truth and foundation of mechanical process.'
