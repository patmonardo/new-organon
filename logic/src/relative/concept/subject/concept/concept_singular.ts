the determinate determinate.`,

    text: `1. At first, therefore, singularity appears
as the reflection of the concept
out of its determinateness into itself.
It is the concept's self-mediation by virtue of which,
since its otherness has once more been made into an other,
it restores itself as self-equal,
but in the determination of absolute negativity.
The negative in the universal,
by virtue of which this universal is a particular,
was earlier determined as a doubly reflective shine.
In so far as the reflective shining is inward,
the particular remains a universal;
through the outward shining,
it is a determinate particular;
the turning back of this side
into the universal is twofold,
either by virtue of an abstraction
that lets the particular fall away
and climbs to a higher and the highest genus,
or by virtue of the singularity
to which the universality in
the determinateness itself descends.
Here is where the false start is made
that makes abstraction stray away
from the way of the concept,
abandoning the truth.
Its higher and highest universal
to which it rises is  only a surface
that becomes progressively more void of content;
the singularity which it scorns is
the depth in which the concept grasps itself
and where it is posited as concept.`,

    text: `Universality and particularity appeared, on the one hand,
as moments of the becoming of singularity.
But it has already been shown that the two are
in themselves the total concept;
consequently, that in singularity they do
not pass over into an other
but that, on the contrary,
what is posited in it is
what they are in and for themselves.
The universal is for itself because it
is absolute mediation in itself,
self-reference only as absolute negativity.
It is an abstract universal
inasmuch as this sublating is an external act
and so a dropping off of the determinateness.
This negativity, therefore, attaches indeed
to the abstract universal,
but it remains outside it,
as a mere condition of it;
it is the abstraction itself
that holds its universal opposite it,
and so the universal does not
have singularity in itself
and remains void of concept.
Life, spirit, God, as well as the pure concept,
are for this reason beyond the grasp of abstraction,
for abstraction keeps singularity away from its products,
and singularity is the principle of
individuality and personality.
And so it comes to nothing but lifeless universalities,
void of spirit, color, and content.`,

    text: `But the unity of the concept is so indissoluble
that these products of abstraction also,
though they are supposed to drop singularity,
are rather themselves singulars.
For in elevating the concrete to universality,
abstraction grasps the universal
as only a determinate universality,
and this is precisely the singularity
that presented itself as self-referring determinateness.
Thus abstraction is a partitioning of the concrete
and an isolating of its determinations;
only singular properties or moments are picked out by it,
for its product must contain what it itself is.
But the difference between this
singularity of its products
and the singularity of the concept is
that in the former the singular and the universal differ
from each other as content and form respectively,
precisely because the content is not the absolute form,
is not the concept itself,
or this form is not the totality of form.
However, this closer consideration shows
that the product of abstraction is
itself the unity of the singular content
and of abstract universality,
therefore that it is something concrete,
the opposite of what it is supposed to be.`,

three particular determinations of
universal, particular, and singular,

the universal and the particular as
species of the particular.
Because singularity is the turning of
the concept as a negative back to itself,
this turning back from abstraction,

But, as this negativity, singularity is

In accordance with this qualitative character, it is,
first, the repulsion of itself from itself

second, it is now a negative reference

Universality, when referred to
these singulars as indifferent ones

is only their commonality.
If by the universal one understands
that which is common to several singulars,
the indifferent subsistence of these singulars is
then taken as the starting point,
