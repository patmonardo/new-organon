# Cognition Structure: Analytic vs Synthetic

## Two Levels

### 1. Analytic (Idea is Unitary)
- **Structure**: Unitary, immediate
- **Character**: Direct apprehension, no mediation
- **Kantian**: General Logic methodology

### 2. Synthetic (Has a Subtriad)
- **Structure**: Triad - Definition, Division, Theorem
- **Character**: Mediated, systematic
- **Kantian**: General Logic methodology
- **Subtriad**:
  - **Definition** (universality)
  - **Division** (particularity)
  - **Theorem** (singularity - transition to idea)

## The Synthetic Subtriad

Following **Kantian General Logic Methodology**:

1. **Definition** (Universality)
   - Universal concept
   - Proximate genus + specific difference
   - First moment of synthetic cognition

2. **Division** (Particularity)
   - Particularization of the universal
   - Systematic disjunction
   - Second moment of synthetic cognition

3. **Theorem** (Singularity)
   - Transition to singularity
   - Proof/Theorem
   - Third moment - transition to idea

## Question: Kant's Treatment of Proof/Theorem

**Does Kant examine Proof/Theorem?**

- **General Logic**: May not examine Proof/Theorem in detail
- **Transcendental Logic** (Critique of Pure Reason): Likely examines Proof/Theorem
  - Makes sense since Critique is "trans Logic" (transcendental logic)
  - Not "general Logic"
  - Transcendental logic deals with conditions of possibility
  - Proof/Theorem would be part of transcendental methodology

## Modern Sloppiness: "Pure" and "Absolute"

**Moderns still sling around these terms of art sloppily.**

- **"Pure"**: Often used without understanding its Kantian meaning
- **"Absolute"**: Often used without understanding its Hegelian meaning
- **Kant struggled**: The sloppiness was hard for Kant to handle LOL

The precision of Hegel's Science of Logic requires careful attention to these terms.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

We want to do this analysis **step by step**:

1. **Analytic**: Understand the unitary idea
2. **Synthetic**: Work through the triad systematically
   - Definition
   - Division
   - Theorem

The TopicMap helps check and improve understanding of Hegel by providing structured, step-by-step analysis.
