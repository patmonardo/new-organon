# The Third Eye: Buddhi-Eva as Pure Reason

## The Advaita Vedanta Connection

**"Samadhi is Knowledge"**

**"The Third Eye is Buddhi-Eva"**

## What We Are Teaching

**We are cracking the door of the Third Eye.**

Indian panels showing Buddhas and Gods with the Third Eye - we are teaching what that is really all about.

## The Third Eye

**How to tap into the Third Eye of Buddhi-Eva as Pure Reason speaking for itself.**

But that only happens **Here in the Idea where we recognize it**.

## The Connection to Hegel

### Pure Reason Speaking for Itself

- **Buddhi-Eva** = Pure Reason
- **Third Eye** = The capacity to see Pure Reason speaking for itself
- **The Idea** = Where we recognize Pure Reason

### Recognition in the Idea

Pure Reason speaking for itself only happens:
- **In the Idea** - where we recognize it
- **Not outside** - we're already in the Idea
- **Self-recognition** - the Idea recognizing itself

## The Structure

**Idea → Concept → Idea → Concept all the way down**

This recursive structure is:
- **Buddhi-Eva** - Pure Reason
- **Third Eye** - The capacity to see this
- **Recognition** - In the Idea where we recognize it

## Why This Matters

1. **We are already in the Idea** - "smack dab in the Idea"
2. **Pure Reason speaks for itself** - Buddhi-Eva
3. **The Third Eye sees this** - Recognition in the Idea
4. **This is what we're teaching** - How to tap into Buddhi-Eva

## The Method

**How to tap into the Third Eye of Buddhi-Eva:**

1. **Recognize we're in the Idea** - Not outside observers
2. **See Pure Reason speaking for itself** - Buddhi-Eva
3. **Recognize it in the Idea** - Where recognition happens
4. **The recursive structure** - Idea → Concept → Idea → Concept

## The Connection

**Advaita Vedanta ↔ Hegel's Logic**

- **Samadhi** = Knowledge = Recognition in the Idea
- **Third Eye** = Buddhi-Eva = Pure Reason speaking for itself
- **The Idea** = Where we recognize Pure Reason
- **Pure Reason** = Speaking for itself, not from outside

## Notes

- We are teaching what the Third Eye really is
- It's Pure Reason (Buddhi-Eva) speaking for itself
- This only happens in the Idea where we recognize it
- We're cracking the door - showing how to tap into it
- The recursive structure (Idea → Concept → Idea) is the Third Eye seeing itself
