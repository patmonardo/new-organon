# Master Chunking Plan for All Logic Sources

## Scope

**Total source files**: ~65+ `.txt` files across the Logic structure

## Strategy

1. **Practice & Refine**: Use `cognition.txt` (Idea of the True) as practice ground
2. **Validate Methodology**: Ensure chunks yield meaningful Logical Operations
3. **Systematic Application**: Apply refined methodology to all sources
4. **Quality Control**: Validate each chunked section before moving on

## Current Status

### ✅ Methodology Established
- `CHUNKING-METHODOLOGY.md` - Principles and process
- `cognition-chunks.md` - Practice chunking plan

### 🔄 In Progress
- **cognition.txt** - Definition, Division, Theorem sections
  - Definition: 12 chunks identified
  - Division: 12 chunks identified  
  - Theorem: To be chunked

### ⏳ Pending
- All other ~63 source files

## Priority Order

### Phase 1: Idea (Current Practice)
1. ✅ `idea.txt` - Introduction
2. 🔄 `cognition.txt` - Idea of Cognition (practicing here)
3. ⏳ `life.txt` - Life
4. ⏳ `speculation.txt` - Absolute Idea (needs redo)

### Phase 2: Concept
- Concept (Universal, Particular, Singular)
- Judgment (Reflection, Existence, Necessity, Concept)
- Syllogism (Existence, Reflection, Necessity)
- Object (Mechanism, Chemism, Teleology)

### Phase 3: Essence
- Essence (Shine, Reflection, Essence)
- Appearance (Thing, World, Relation)
- Actuality (Actuality, Substance, Absolute)

### Phase 4: Being
- Quality (Being, Existence, Being-for-self)
- Quantity (Quantity, Quantum, Ratio)
- Measure (Specific Quantity, Real Measure, Becoming-Essence)

## File Inventory

### Idea Sources (4 files)
- [x] `idea.txt` - Introduction
- [ ] `cognition.txt` - Idea of Cognition (in progress)
- [ ] `life.txt` - Life
- [ ] `speculation.txt` - Absolute Idea (needs redo)

### Concept Sources (~20 files)
- Concept: universal.txt, particular.txt, singular.txt
- Judgment: reflection.txt, existence.txt, necessity.txt, concept.txt
- Syllogism: existence.txt, reflection.txt, necessity.txt
- Object: mechanism.txt, chemism.txt, teleology sources

### Essence Sources (~20 files)
- Essence: shine.txt, reflection.txt, essence.txt
- Appearance: thing.txt, world.txt, relation sources
- Actuality: actuality.txt, substance.txt, absolute.txt

### Being Sources (~20 files)
- Quality: being.txt, existence sources, being-for-self sources
- Quantity: quantity.txt, quantum.txt, number.txt, ratio sources
- Measure: specific-quantity.txt, real-measure.txt, becoming-essence.txt

## Quality Gates

Before moving to next file:
1. ✅ Chunks follow methodology
2. ✅ Each chunk analyzable as Logical Operation
3. ✅ Chunks connect logically
4. ✅ Dialectical structure respected
5. ✅ Meaningful operations extracted

## Notes

- **"Garbage in garbage out"**: Poor chunking → meaningless Logical Operations
- **Systematic approach**: Must be consistent across all files
- **Practice first**: Refine methodology on cognition before scaling
- **Validation**: Each section must be validated before proceeding
