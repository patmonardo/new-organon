# Idea Digesting the Products of Reflection

## The Key Insight

**We are NOT in the System of Reflection - we are in the Idea.**

**Reflection feeds the Absolute which feeds the Concept.**

**But in the Idea we are not being fed - we are Digesting.**

## The Flow

**Reflection → Absolute → Concept → Idea**

- **Reflection** = Feeds
- **Absolute** = Feeds
- **Concept** = Fed
- **Idea** = **Digesting** (not being fed)

## Markers for External Reflection

**Definition resorting to Marks = Markers for external reflection**

**Markers are taken up into the Concept.**

But:
- **In Reflection** = Markers for external reflection
- **In Idea** = We digest these markers
- **Not being fed** = We're digesting

## The Idea Digests

**The Idea digests the Products of Reflection/Essential Relations:**

- Products of Reflection
- Essential Relations
- Markers taken up into Concept
- All digested by the Idea

## Concept vs Idea

**The Concept is a mere compression schema.**

**The Idea converts the Concept to Principles and the Idea.**

- **Concept** = Compression schema
- **Idea** = Converts Concept to Principles
- **Idea** = Converts Concept to Idea itself

## Why This Matters

1. **We're in the Idea** = Not in Reflection
2. **Not being fed** = We're digesting
3. **Idea digests** = Products of Reflection/Essential Relations
4. **Concept** = Compression schema
5. **Idea** = Converts Concept to Principles and Idea

## The Structure

**Reflection System:**
- Feeds Absolute
- Markers for external reflection
- Products of Reflection
- Essential Relations

**Absolute:**
- Fed by Reflection
- Feeds Concept

**Concept:**
- Fed by Absolute
- Compression schema
- Takes up markers

**Idea:**
- **Digesting** (not being fed)
- Digests Products of Reflection/Essential Relations
- Converts Concept to Principles
- Converts Concept to Idea

## Notes

- We're in the Idea, not Reflection
- Reflection feeds Absolute feeds Concept
- In Idea we're digesting, not being fed
- Idea digests Products of Reflection/Essential Relations
- Concept = Compression schema
- Idea = Converts Concept to Principles and Idea
- Markers taken up into Concept, digested by Idea
