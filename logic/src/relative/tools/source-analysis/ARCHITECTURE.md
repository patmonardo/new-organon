# Source Analysis Architecture

## The Real Work: Cognitive Science

**Cognition** - This is Cognitive Science, or perhaps **the Principle of Cognitive Science**.

The real cognitive work happens in **Source Analysis**: the skill of producing good chunks and topics. This alone helps us comprehend the source and is the foundation for everything that follows.

**Source Analysis should be readable** - a type of **structured meal** to help digest the Logic. When we create good chunks and topics, we're creating a digestible form of Hegelian Logic that the mind can actually comprehend and work with.

## Semantic Flow: Chunking → Mapping

**Chunking (Human Consumption):**
- TopicChunking - extracting Topics
- Human-readable, digestible
- Shows up in Technical parts

**TopicMap (Technical Artifact):**
- From Chunking
- Technical artifact
- Maps Topics → Logical Operations

**IR (Logical Operations):**
- No longer needs to maintain chunks directly
- Flows through TopicMap
- Will be reinvented later
- For now, stick with Chunking

**Flow:** Chunking → TopicMap → LO → LO Map → TS

**IR Architecture:**
- **IR can presuppose TopicMap as TS Module** - TopicMap is a TS module that IR can import/presuppose
- **IR focused on LO → FO** - Form Processor Operations (not just maintaining chunks)
- **LO → FO** = Logical Operations → Form Processor Operations

## Key Insight

**Good chunking/topic analysis → Meaningful HLOs → Executable codegen**

If HLO translation starts with good chunking/topic analysis, it makes sense and shows the way to the final executable codegen.

## Source Analysis: The Cognitive Work

### What Makes Good Chunking?

1. **Logical Units**: Chunks capture complete logical thoughts
2. **Conceptual Boundaries**: Clear separation of ideas
3. **Relationships**: Topics track how concepts connect
4. **Comprehension**: The chunking process itself aids understanding

### What Makes Good Topics?

1. **Structured Planning**: Topics plan chunks before extraction
2. **Clear Mapping**: Topics map to Chunks and Logical Operations
3. **Status Tracking**: Progress visible through status
4. **Relationships**: `relatedChunks` show concept connections

## HLOs as Intermediate Representation

HLOs are **pure Intermediate Representations for Hegelian Logic**:

- **Input**: Good chunks and topics from Source Analysis
- **Structure**: Clauses, predicates, relations
- **Output**: Executable codegen

They're the structured bridge between human comprehension (Source Analysis) and machine execution (codegen).

## The Workflow

1. **Source Analysis** (Cognitive Science)
   - Read and understand the source
   - Create chunks: logical units of thought
   - Create topics: structured comprehension
   - **This is where the real cognitive work happens**

2. **HLO Generation** (IR Translation)
   - Extract clauses from chunks
   - Identify predicates and relations
   - Structure as HLOs
   - **Meaningful because of good Source Analysis**

3. **Codegen** (Backend)
   - Transform HLOs to executable code
   - The final "backend" that runs
   - **Enabled by structured HLOs**

## Why This Matters

- **Source Analysis is primary**: Without good chunking/topics, HLOs are just jargon
- **Source Analysis is readable**: A structured meal to digest the Logic
- **HLOs are IR**: They're the structured bridge, not the goal
- **IR/Codegen is Speculative Art**: Encoding the structure of thought itself
- **Codegen is backend**: The final executable form - the Absolute Idea realized
- **Cognition is the principle**: Understanding comes from Source Analysis
- **Highest Realms of Mind**: We're encoding the Science of Logic itself

## Example: Cognition

Working through **Cognition** demonstrates this:

- **Source Analysis**: Chunking Hegel's text on synthetic cognition
- **Topics**: Structured plan for Definition, Division, Theorem
- **HLOs**: Structured representation of logical operations
- **Codegen**: Executable form (future)

The skill in producing chunks and topics is what makes everything else meaningful.
