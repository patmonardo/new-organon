# Pure Form vs Given Form: Abstract/Concrete Dialectic

## The Model

**Pure Form** = FormShape, ridding it of "Values" which are external concrete existences

**Given Form** = The Contained, the Appearance/Idea

## The Structure

**Pure Form:**
- Abstracted Pure Schema
- FormShape without Values
- Container
- Deals with Abstracted Pure Schema

**Given Form:**
- Contained
- Appearance/Idea
- Has Values (external concrete existences)
- The Contained

## The Relationship

**Pure Form = Container**
**Given Form = Contained**

Pure Form contains Given Form. Given Form is the Appearance/Idea contained within Pure Form.

## Abstract/Concrete Dialectic

**This models the power of Abstract/Concrete dialectic.**

It's a type of **Compression**:
- Pure Form = Abstracted (compressed)
- Given Form = Concrete (contained)
- The dialectic between them = Compression

## The Concept

**The concept is overall a reduction to simplest moment.**

This reduction:
- From manifold determinations
- To simplest moments
- Pure Form abstracts from concrete existences
- Given Form contains the concrete

## Manifold of Intuition vs Manifold of Sensation

**"Reduces manifold determinations to simplest moments"**

This must be:
- **Manifold of Intuition** (Pure Form, abstracted)
- vs **Manifold of Sensation** (Given Form, concrete)

The reduction from manifold of sensation to manifold of intuition = reduction to simplest moments.

## Notes

- Pure Form = FormShape without Values = Abstracted Pure Schema = Container
- Given Form = Contained = Appearance/Idea = Has Values
- Abstract/Concrete dialectic = Compression
- Concept = reduction to simplest moment
- Manifold of Sensation → Manifold of Intuition = reduction to simplest moments

## Connection to Form Processor Architecture

**Hegel's "no principle" → Our Eval method**

- **Eval** = Given FormShape (Pure Form) and Entity (Appearances/Given Form)
- **Eval is projected from AbsoluteForm**
- **GDS Kernel** = Controls Pure Form as Container
- **Absolute Form** = Divides FormShape and FormEntity
- **UserLand Form Processor** = Presupposes Pure FormShape, Eval method, Impure FormEntity

See `FORM-PROCESSOR-ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full architecture.

## Kant Question (To Work Through Later)

Kant's Qualitative Being with Perception vs Intuition as ext/int magnitudes - need to work through this to see what meaning we can find. But focusing on Hegel here.
