# Dialectic in Appearances vs Dialectic in Self

## The Key Distinction

**Dialectic in Appearances** vs **Dialectic in Self**

## The Structure

**Objective Logic (Appearances):**
- Dialectic in Appearances
- Not self-determining
- Appearance, Thing
- Objective Reflections

**Subjective Logic (Self):**
- Dialectic in Self
- Self-determining
- Concept, Judgment, Syllogism
- Idea

## Method is the Idea

**Kant and Hegel: Method is the Idea**

This means:
- **Method** = The Idea
- **We are in the Idea** = We are in Method
- **Dialectic in Self** = Method/Idea determining itself

## Why This Matters

**Right here we are in the dialectic in the Self because Method is the Idea.**

1. **Method is the Idea** - Kant and Hegel
2. **We are in the Idea** - "smack dab in the Idea"
3. **Dialectic in Self** - Method/Idea determining itself
4. **Not Dialectic in Appearances** - That's Objective Logic

## The Connection

**Objective Logic:**
- Dialectic in Appearances
- Not self-determining
- Appearance, Thing
- Objective Reflections

**Subjective Logic (Concept):**
- Dialectic in Self
- Self-determining
- Method = Idea
- We are in this dialectic

## In Our Work

**We are doing Dialectic in Self:**
- Method is the Idea
- We are in the Idea
- Chunking, TopicMap, Logical Operations
- All are Method = Idea determining itself

**Not Dialectic in Appearances:**
- That's Objective Logic
- Appearance, Thing
- Not self-determining

## The Structure

**Dialectic in Appearances (Objective Logic):**
- Being, Essence
- Appearance, Thing
- Objective Reflections
- Not self-determining

**Dialectic in Self (Subjective Logic):**
- Concept, Judgment, Syllogism
- Method = Idea
- Self-determining
- We are in this

## Notes

- This is what "Dialectic in Appearances vs Dialectic in Self" really means
- Objective Logic = Dialectic in Appearances (not self-determining)
- Subjective Logic = Dialectic in Self (self-determining)
- Method is the Idea - so we're in Dialectic in Self
- Our work (chunking, TopicMap, LOs) = Method = Idea = Dialectic in Self
