# Analytic Cognition - Reading Guide

**Location**: `cognition.txt` lines 753-1207

**Status**: Needs chunking and TopicMap entry

## Overview

Analytic Cognition is the **first premise of the whole syllogism** - the immediate reference of the concept to the object. It is **unitary** (no subtriad), unlike Synthetic Cognition which has Definition, Division, Theorem.

## Key Points

### 1. Immediate Communication (lines 778-805)
- **No mediation** - immediate communication of the concept
- **Abstract identity** - form of simple identity, abstract universality
- **No transition to other** - linking of different terms excluded
- **Subjective** - immanent reflection is only subjective

### 2. Starts from Presupposition (lines 806-867)
- Begins from **singular, concrete subject matter**
- Analysis transforms given material into logical determinations
- **Both positing and presupposing** - not to be separated
- Logical element appears as:
  - Already completed in subject matter (presupposing)
  - Product of subjective activity (positing)

### 3. No Further Middle Terms (lines 868-926)
- Does not go through further middle terms
- Determination is **immediate** - belongs to subject matter in itself
- Progress happens solely in determinations of the material
- Relations (whole/part, cause/effect) are **given** - outside its competence
- **Kant's observation**: Synthetic principles a priori rooted in unity of self-consciousness
- But Kant took specific connections from formal logic as given

### 4. Analytical Science (Arithmetic/Algebra) (lines 949-1005)
- **Arithmetic and algebra** = most immanently analytical
- Material is **abstract one** - relationless atom
- Increasing/limiting = empty progression
- Relations depend on positing activity of knowing subject
- **Guiding principle**: Immanent principle of analytical identity
- Progression = reduction of unequal to ever greater equality

### 5. Problems vs Theorems (lines 1007-1068)
- Analytical science has **problems**, not theorems
- Analytical theorem contains problem as already resolved
- **Kant**: 5 + 7 = 12 is synthetic (plurality vs unity)
- **Hegel**: 5 + 7 and 12 are absolutely the same content
- **Problem** = contains content and assigns operation
- Operation is external, subjective act

### 6. Proof in Analytical Science (lines 1048-1113)
- Proof = mere continuation/repetition of same operation
- **Tautological**: Solution correct because operation performed
- Applying geometrical method (synthetic) = superfluous scaffolding
- Higher analysis (powers) contains synthetic determinations
- But development is still totally analytical

### 7. Infinite Analysis (Differential/Integral Calculus) (lines 1155-1179)
- Underlying **qualitative determination** - can only be comprehended by concept
- Transition from magnitude to this determination is **not analytic**
- Mathematics cannot justify operations internally/mathematically
- Once transition presupposed, further course is analytical

### 8. Transition to Synthetic (lines 1181-1207)
- Analysis becomes synthetic when determinations not posited by problems themselves
- **General transition**: From immediacy to mediation, abstract identity to difference
- Analysis restricts to self-referential determinations
- But determinateness also refers to other by nature
- Abstract identity is **identity in difference**
- Connection must become posited by concept, identical with it

## Structure

**Analytic Cognition is UNitary** - no subtriad like Synthetic Cognition.

It is the **first premise**:
- Immediate reference of concept to object
- Identity is its determination
- Apprehension of what is

**Synthetic Cognition** (second premise) aims at **comprehension** of what is.

## Notes

- We skipped Analytic Cognition in our chunking plan
- Need to add it to TopicMap
- It's important foundation for understanding Synthetic Cognition
- Shows the transition from immediacy to mediation
