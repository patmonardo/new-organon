# Chunking Methodology for Logic Sources

## Purpose

To systematically chunk Hegel's Logic text into meaningful, analyzable units that yield meaningful Logical Operations. This addresses the "garbage in garbage out" problem - poor chunking leads to meaningless logical operations.

## Principles

### 1. Logical Completeness
- Each chunk should represent a **complete logical thought** or **dialectical moment**
- Not arbitrary paragraph breaks, but **conceptually bounded units**
- Should be able to stand as a coherent logical operation

### 2. Dialectical Structure
- Respect the **three-fold structure** (universality, particularity, singularity)
- Identify **transitions** between moments
- Capture **sublations** and **contradictions**

### 3. Size Guidelines
- **Too small**: Fragments that lose context
- **Too large**: Multiple logical operations mixed together
- **Just right**: One complete logical thought that can be analyzed

### 4. Boundary Identification
- **Natural breaks**: Section headers, numbered items
- **Logical breaks**: Completion of a thought, transition to new moment
- **Dialectical breaks**: Sublation, contradiction resolution

### 5. Hierarchical Structure
- **Top level**: Major sections (e.g., "Definition", "Division", "Theorem")
- **Second level**: Logical moments within sections
- **Third level**: Sub-moments if needed

## Chunking Process

### Step 1: Identify Major Sections
- Look for explicit section markers (1., 2., 3., A., B., etc.)
- Identify natural topic boundaries
- Note transitions between major concepts

### Step 2: Analyze Each Section
- Read for **complete thoughts**
- Identify **dialectical moments**
- Note **transitions** and **sublations**
- Mark **examples** and **illustrations** (may be separate chunks)

### Step 3: Create Logical Chunks
- Each chunk = one complete logical operation
- Should be analyzable independently
- Should connect to adjacent chunks

### Step 4: Validate Chunks
- Can this chunk be analyzed as a Logical Operation?
- Does it have a clear logical structure?
- Does it connect properly to adjacent chunks?
- Is it the right size (not too small, not too large)?

## Chunk Metadata

Each chunk should have:
- **Title**: Descriptive name of the logical moment
- **Line range**: Exact lines in source text
- **Logical structure**: What kind of logical operation (definition, transition, sublation, etc.)
- **Key concepts**: Main concepts introduced or developed
- **Relations**: How it relates to previous/next chunks

## Quality Criteria

A good chunk:
1. ✅ Represents a complete logical thought
2. ✅ Can be analyzed as a Logical Operation
3. ✅ Has clear boundaries (beginning and end)
4. ✅ Connects logically to adjacent chunks
5. ✅ Is the right size for analysis
6. ✅ Respects dialectical structure

A bad chunk:
1. ❌ Arbitrary paragraph break
2. ❌ Multiple logical operations mixed
3. ❌ Incomplete thought
4. ❌ Loses context
5. ❌ Ignores dialectical structure

## Application

We will:
1. **Practice** on cognition.txt (Definition, Division, Theorem)
2. **Refine** methodology based on practice
3. **Apply** systematically to all Logic sources
4. **Validate** that chunks yield meaningful Logical Operations

## Current Status

- ✅ Methodology document created
- 🔄 Practicing on cognition.txt
- ⏳ To be applied to all Logic sources
