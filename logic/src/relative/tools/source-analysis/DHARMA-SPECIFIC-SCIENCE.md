# Dharma = Specific Science

## The Insight

**Chunk 2.7 introduces the notion of a "specific science" because that is what a Dharma is.**

**A Dharma is a Specific Science.**

**Not just any concept or idea. But for us, philosophy as knowing has a special membership protocol.**

**Pure a priori syntheses as Dichotomies with Two Members.**

**Which are really Perfect Divisions which yield Perfect Sciences. Certainty!**

## The Text (lines 1830-1837)

> Any object, therefore, that seems to possess
> an elementary universality is
> made the subject matter of a specific science:
> it makes an absolute beginning
> because ordinary acquaintance with it is presupposed,
> and the assumption made is
> that it stands on its own with no need of derivation.
> Definition takes it as an immediate.

## The Connection

**Dharma = Specific Science**

- **Dharma** = That which stands on its own, makes absolute beginning
- **Specific Science** = Subject matter with elementary universality
- **Not just any concept or idea** = Must have elementary universality
- **Philosophy as knowing** = Has special membership protocol

## Pure A Priori Syntheses

**Pure a priori syntheses as Dichotomies with Two Members:**

- **Dichotomy** = Two Members
- **Perfect Division** = Dichotomy with Two Members
- **Perfect Sciences** = Yielded by Perfect Divisions
- **Certainty** = Result of Perfect Sciences

## The Protocol

**Philosophy as knowing has a special membership protocol:**

1. **Elementary universality** = Subject matter of specific science
2. **Absolute beginning** = Stands on its own, no derivation needed
3. **Ordinary acquaintance presupposed** = Immediate, given
4. **Definition takes as immediate** = Not derived, presupposed
5. **Pure a priori syntheses** = Dichotomies with Two Members
6. **Perfect Divisions** = Yield Perfect Sciences
7. **Certainty** = Result

## The Architecture

**Dharma = Specific Science = Perfect Division = Perfect Science = Certainty**

- **Dharma** = Specific Science (elementary universality)
- **Perfect Division** = Dichotomy with Two Members
- **Perfect Science** = Result of Perfect Division
- **Certainty** = Result of Perfect Science

## Notes

- Chunk 2.7 introduces "specific science"
- A Dharma is a Specific Science
- Not just any concept or idea
- Philosophy as knowing has special membership protocol
- Pure a priori syntheses as Dichotomies with Two Members
- Perfect Divisions yield Perfect Sciences
- Certainty!
