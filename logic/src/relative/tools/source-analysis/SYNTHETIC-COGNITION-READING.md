# Synthetic Cognition - Definition, Division, Theorem

**Location**: `cognition.txt` lines 1289-2728

**Structure**: Follows **Kantian General Logic Methodology**
- **Definition** (universality) - lines 1289-1648
- **Division** (particularity) - lines 1649-2013
- **Theorem** (singularity - transition to idea) - lines 2014-2728

**Note**: Kant doesn't discuss Theorem as thoroughly as Hegel does. Hegel's treatment goes deeper.

## 1. Definition (Universality) - lines 1289-1648

### Key Points

**Transformation to Concept Form** (lines 1291-1312)
- Still given objectivity transformed into simple form (form of concept)
- Moments: universality, particularity, singularity
- Singular = object to be defined
- Universal = genus (proximate genus)
- Particular = specific difference, determinate species

**Reduces to Concept** (lines 1314-1337)
- Gets rid of externalities
- Abstracts from what is added in realization
- Reduces manifold determinations to simplest moments
- Subject matter = universal which is determined
- Singular = genus + particularization in one

**Cognition is Subjective** (lines 1339-1359)
- Concept finds reality that corresponds to it
- But singularity not contained in this reality
- Cognition is subjective, has external beginning
- Content is given and contingent
- Contingent in two respects: content and choice of determinations

**Three Cases** (lines 1361-1471)
1. **Products of purposiveness** (easy) - purpose determines essential particularization
2. **Geometrical/arithmetic objects** - abstract determinations, posited
3. **Concrete objects** (nature/spirit) - many properties, no criterion but existence itself
   - Would require theorems and proof

**Resorts to Marks** (lines 1473-1500)
- Definition = first, undeveloped concept
- Must employ immediate properties
- Resorts to empirical universality
- Forfeits true concept determinations
- Contents itself with marks (external reflection)

**Problems** (lines 1501-1637)
- Single external determinateness too disproportionate (e.g., lobe of ear)
- Properties external to themselves
- Bad specimens may lack properties
- Concept maintained despite contradiction
- Content from immediate existence - no justification, no necessity

**Passes Over to Division** (lines 1639-1647)
- Immediacy proceeds from mediation
- Determinateness mediated by its other
- Must pass over into division

## 2. Division (Particularity) - lines 1649-2013

### Key Points

**Necessity of Division** (lines 1651-1668)
- Universal must particularize itself
- Necessity lies in universal
- But definition begins with particular
- Particular points to an other
- Universal presupposed for division
- Singular content raised to universality

**Transition from Universal to Particular** (lines 1670-1679)
- Transition determined by form of concept
- Advance from universal to particular
- Basis for synthetic science, system, systematic cognition

**Beginning with Universal** (lines 1681-1712)
- Beginning must be with universal
- In actuality, concrete singularity given first
- But in conceptual comprehension, simple/abstract comes first
- Objection: intuition easier than cognition
- But cognition requires method appropriate to cognition
- Abstract simple easier to grasp than concrete

**Universal First Moment** (lines 1723-1738)
- Universal = first moment of concept (simple)
- Particular = after (mediated)
- Simple = more universal
- Concrete presupposes transition from first
- Applies to ordering of whole

**Examples** (lines 1739-1816)
- Reading: begin with elements, not whole words
- Geometry: begin with point/line, not concrete space
- Physics: free properties from entanglements
- Colors: universal form is spectrum (middle)

**No Immanent Limit** (lines 1818-1837)
- Universal itself only member of division
- Higher universal, higher yet, to infinity
- No immanent limit
- Proceeds from given
- Abstract universality defines "first"

**Lacks Principle** (lines 1839-1873)
- Division immediately next step
- Would require immanent principle
- But lacks such principle
- Follows form determination without immanent reflection
- Takes determinateness from what is given
- No specific reason for particular
- Can only arrange empirical material, discover by comparison

**Formal Rules Lead Nowhere** (lines 1875-1897)
- Only formal, empty rules
- Rule: division should exhaust concept
- But each member must exhaust concept
- Empirical manifold internally void of determination
- Exhaustion = tautological (list all species)

**Physical Nature's Contingency** (lines 1935-1967)
- Physical nature presents contingency
- External dependency, manifold connectedness
- Assortment of principles
- Hybrids go in different directions
- Impossible to abide by any principle
- Species simply diverse, not opposed

**Instinct of Reason** (lines 1969-2012)
- Contingency of particular
- May be attributed to instinct of reason
- Discover bases more adequate to concept
- Example: animals - teeth/claws as criterion
- Plant: reproductive parts
- Highest point, transition to sexual difference

## 3. The Theorem (Singularity) - lines 2014-2728

### Key Points

**Transition of Particularity to Singularity** (lines 2016-2038)
- Third stage: transition of particularity to singularity
- Self-referring determinateness
- Internal differentiation
- Connection of differentiated determinacies
- Definition = one determinateness
- Division = determinateness against other
- Singularization = subject matter parted internally
- Theorems = subject matter known in reality/conditions/forms
- Exhibits idea = unity of concept and reality
- But cognition still seeking, reality does not proceed from concept

**Theorem as Properly Synthetic Element** (lines 2040-2078)
- Theorem = properly synthetic element
- Relations necessary, grounded in inner identity of concept
- Definition/division = external connectedness, content displayed
- Theorem = demonstratively displayed
- Content proceeds from concept's moment of singularity
- Determinations of reality
- Concept goes over to otherness/reality, becoming idea
- Synthesis lacks concept form justification
- Proof necessary

**Difficulty: Definition vs Theorem** (lines 2080-2112)
- No principle readily available
- What pertains immediately vs mediated
- Content of definition is itself essentially mediated
- Immediacy only subjective
- Even Euclid has presuppositions (parallel lines axiom)

## Structure Summary

**Definition** (Universality)
- Transforms given objectivity to concept form
- Reduces to simplest moments
- But resorts to marks, external determinateness
- Content from immediate existence - no justification
- Passes over to division

**Division** (Particularity)
- Universal must particularize itself
- Beginning with universal (not concrete)
- But lacks immanent principle
- Takes determinateness from given
- Can only arrange empirical material
- Instinct of reason discovers bases

**Theorem** (Singularity - Transition to Idea)
- Transition of particularity to singularity
- Self-referring determinateness, internal differentiation
- Properly synthetic element - relations necessary
- Content from singularity = determinations of reality
- Concept goes over to otherness/reality, becoming idea
- Proof necessary

## Notes

- **Kantian General Logic Methodology**: Definition, Division follow Kant
- **Kant doesn't discuss Theorem as thoroughly**: Hegel goes deeper
- **All three stages have limitations**: Each reveals finitude of synthetic cognition
- **Theorem is transition to idea**: Concept goes over to otherness/reality
- **Proof becomes necessary**: Because synthesis lacks concept form justification
