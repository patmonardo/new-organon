# Chunk 1.1: Introduction - Transformation to Concept Form

**Lines**: 1291-1312  
**Section**: Definition (Universality)  
**Order**: 1

## The Text

```
To start with, the still given objectivity is
transformed into simple form, as the first form
and therefore as the form of the concept;
the moments of this apprehension are none other, therefore,
than the moments of the concept;
universality, particularity, and singularity.
The singular is the object itself as
an immediate representation;
it is that which is to be defined.
The universal of this singular object
took the form of genus in
the determination of the objective judgment,
or the judgment of necessity;
more precisely, it took the form of the proximate genus,
that is to say, of the universal with the determinateness
which is at the same time the principle for
the differentiation of the particular.
This is a difference that the subject matter
receives in its specific non-indifference,
the one that makes it a determinate species
and is the basis of its disjunction
from the remaining species.
```

## Key Points

- **Still given objectivity** transformed into simple form (form of concept)
- **Moments**: universality, particularity, and singularity
- **Singular** = object itself as immediate representation = that which is to be defined
- **Universal** = genus (proximate genus) = universal with determinateness that is principle for differentiation of particular
- **Particular** = specific difference, determinate species = basis of disjunction from remaining species

## Analysis

This is the opening of Definition - the first moment of synthetic cognition (universality).

The transformation: Given objectivity → Concept form

The structure:
- **Singular** = what is to be defined (the object)
- **Universal** = proximate genus (with determinateness)
- **Particular** = specific difference (determinate species)

## Questions for Study

1. What does "still given objectivity" mean?
2. How is it "transformed into simple form"?
3. Why are these the moments of the concept?
4. What is "proximate genus"?
5. How does the particular differentiate from remaining species?

## Notes

This chunk establishes the basic structure of Definition:
- Object (singular) to be defined
- Genus (universal) - proximate genus
- Specific difference (particular) - what makes it a determinate species
