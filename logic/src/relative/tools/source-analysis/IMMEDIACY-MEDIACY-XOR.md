# Immediacy → Mediacy: Exclusive Or (XOR) Dichotomy

## The Pure A Priori Logic

**"Immediacy has to pass over into Mediacy"**

**Exclusive Or! Dichotomy**

## The Structure

**Immediacy → Mediacy**

This is:
- **Exclusive Or (XOR)**
- **Dichotomy**
- Pure A Priori Logic

## Why This Matters

1. **Immediacy** = Cannot remain immediate
2. **Must pass over** = Transition required
3. **Into Mediacy** = The mediated
4. **Exclusive Or** = Either immediacy OR mediacy (not both)
5. **Dichotomy** = Two mutually exclusive states

## The Logical Structure

**XOR (Exclusive Or):**
- Either A or B, but not both
- Immediacy OR Mediacy
- Cannot be both immediate and mediated at once
- Must pass over = transition

**Dichotomy:**
- Two mutually exclusive options
- Immediacy vs Mediacy
- Must choose/transition
- Pure A Priori Logic

## In Hegel

**Immediacy has to pass over into Mediacy:**

- This is Pure A Priori Logic
- Not empirical
- Not contingent
- Necessary transition
- Exclusive Or structure

## The Connection

**Pure A Priori Logic:**
- Immediacy → Mediacy
- Exclusive Or (XOR)
- Dichotomy
- Necessary transition

**This is the structure of the Logic itself:**
- Cannot remain immediate
- Must pass over
- Into mediacy
- Exclusive Or = Either/Or (not both)

## Notes

- Immediacy has to pass over into Mediacy = Pure A Priori Logic
- Exclusive Or (XOR) = Either immediacy OR mediacy (not both)
- Dichotomy = Two mutually exclusive states
- This is the structure of the Logic itself
- Necessary transition = Pure A Priori
