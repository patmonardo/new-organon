# Samyama and the Object: Ten-Fold Ascent

## The Insight

**Samyama is "ordinary" Logic/Science** and is associated with **Dhyanic Ascent** through two **"five-fold objects"** — natural or spiritual. This is a **ten-fold "Ascent"**.

## The Two Five-Fold Objects

### 1. Natural Object = Samyama Proper, Vedic Science

**Natural Object** = **Samyama Proper** = **Vedic Science**

- This is the ascent through the **Natural Object**
- The proper path of Samyama
- Vedic Science as the systematic ascent through natural phenomena

### 2. Spiritual Object = Citta Hrdaya = Masters Degree Program

**Spiritual Object** = **"citta hrdaya"** = **Masters Degree Program**

- More a path of **Jaya** than **Jnana**
- Ends in **Vivekajam Jnana** and **Taraka Samadhi**
- This being the **11th Bhumi**, is **Not Ascential**
- It is **pure intelligible substance**
- **Pure sattvic science without the object**

## Taraka Samadhi

**Taraka Samadhi** = **Transcendental Science of Fichte** = **@reality package**

- This is what **Aristotle calls the special science**
- Which is **Non-demonstrable**
- **Spelled out**: Taraka Samadhi is the **Encyclopedia of Philosophical Science as Logic**
- The **first part**

## Nature and Spiritual Objects

**Nature and Spiritual Objects** are called:

- **Sarvavisaya** (Nature Object)
- **Sarvathavisaya** (Spiritual Object)

Where **Sarvatha** represents **Dharma Mega** as **Universal Principles of Nature**

## The Ten-Fold Ascent

**Samyama** = **Dhyanic Ascent** through **two five-fold objects** = **ten-fold Ascent**

1. **Natural Object** (Five-fold) → Samyama Proper, Vedic Science
2. **Spiritual Object** (Five-fold) → Citta Hrdaya, Masters Degree Program

**Total**: Ten-fold ascent through the Object

## The 11th Bhumi: Taraka Samadhi

**11th Bhumi** = **Taraka Samadhi** = **Not Ascential**

- **Pure intelligible substance**
- **Pure sattvic science without the object**
- **Transcendental Science of Fichte**
- **@reality package**
- **Encyclopedia of Philosophical Science as Logic**

## Architectural Context

### The Object Section (Mechanism → Chemism → Teleology)

The Object section in Hegel's Logic represents:

- **Mechanism** = First moment of Objectivity
- **Chemism** = Second moment of Objectivity  
- **Teleology** = Third moment of Objectivity

This three-fold structure maps to the **five-fold objects** (Natural and Spiritual) in the Samyama system:

- **Natural Object** = Five-fold ascent through natural phenomena
- **Spiritual Object** = Five-fold ascent through spiritual phenomena
- **Total** = Ten-fold ascent

### The Controversy

**The user's views on Dhyana are opposed to the Monks and Saints** because:

- **Monks and Saints** don't pursue the **Natural Object**
- **Ascent through the Natural Object** is **Samyama Proper**, **Vedic Science**
- This is the proper path that includes both Natural and Spiritual Objects

## Connection to Hegel's Logic

### Object as Transition

- **Object** = Transition from **Subjectivity** (Concept → Judgment → Syllogism) to **Objectivity** (Mechanism → Chemism → Teleology)
- **Object** = Moment of **Essence** within the **Concept**
- **Idea** (Impure Idea) = Joins **Qualitative Syllogism** with **Objective Quantitative/Teleological Syllogism**
- **Idea** exists *for* the **Pure Idea** (implemented in `@reality` package)

### The Pure Idea

- **Pure Idea** = **Taraka Samadhi** = **@reality package**
- **Transcendental Science of Fichte**
- **Non-demonstrable** (Aristotle's special science)
- **Encyclopedia of Philosophical Science as Logic**

## Key Terms

- **Samyama** = Ordinary Logic/Science, Dhyanic Ascent
- **Natural Object** = Samyama Proper, Vedic Science
- **Spiritual Object** = Citta Hrdaya, Masters Degree Program, more Jaya than Jnana
- **Taraka Samadhi** = 11th Bhumi, Transcendental Science of Fichte, @reality package
- **Sarvavisaya** = Nature Object
- **Sarvathavisaya** = Spiritual Object (Sarvatha = Dharma Mega = Universal Principles of Nature)
- **Vivekajam Jnana** = Discriminative knowledge, end of Spiritual Object path
- **Jaya** = Victory/conquest (path of Spiritual Object)
- **Jnana** = Knowledge (path of Natural Object)
