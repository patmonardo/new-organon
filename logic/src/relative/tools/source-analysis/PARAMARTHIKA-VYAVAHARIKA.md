# Paramarthika and Vyavaharika: The Two Levels

## The Sanskrit Terms

**Paramarthika** (पारमार्थिक)
- **Param** = highest, ultimate, absolute
- **Arthika** = meaning, truth, reality
- **The Ultimate/Absolute Level**
- The Idea that resides above the transactional

**Vyavaharika** (व्यावहारिक)
- **Vyavahara** = transaction, convention, practical usage
- **Hari** = component (also name of Vishnu, but here part of vyavahara)
- **The Transactional/Conventional Level**
- The level of syllogistic chains, prosyllogisms

## How Logic Works

**Logic doesn't work from chasing prosyllogisms through Qualitative and Quantitative chains of syllogisms.**

**Science works from recognizing the Idea.**

### The Two Levels in Hegel

**Vyavaharika (Transactional Level)**
- Qualitative syllogisms
- Quantitative syllogisms
- Chains of prosyllogisms
- The apparent "method" of building logic step by step
- The conventional level of logical operations

**Paramarthika (Ultimate Level)**
- The Idea
- Absolute truth
- What Science actually works from
- Recognition, not chasing
- The absolute standpoint

## The Method

### What Logic Doesn't Do

Logic doesn't work by:
- Chasing prosyllogisms
- Following qualitative chains
- Following quantitative chains
- Building syllogism upon syllogism
- Step-by-step accumulation

### What Logic Does

Logic works by:
- **Recognizing the Idea**
- Seeing the Paramarthika level
- Understanding from the absolute standpoint
- The Idea recognizing itself
- Science recognizing the absolute

## In Our Work

When we chunk and analyze Hegel, we're not:
- Building syllogisms step by step
- Chasing logical chains
- Following prosyllogisms
- Working at the Vyavaharika level

We're:
- **Recognizing the Idea**
- Seeing the Paramarthika structure
- Working from the absolute level
- The Idea recognizing itself through our work
- Science recognizing the absolute

## The Connection

**We are already in the Idea (Paramarthika)**

We're not chasing through syllogistic chains (Vyavaharika). We're recognizing the Idea that makes sense of everything.

**Science works from recognizing the Idea** - not from chasing prosyllogisms.
