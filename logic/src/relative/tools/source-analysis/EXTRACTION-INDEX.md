# Logical Operation Extraction: Index

## Overview

**Extract what is Logical from the Science of Logic**—crystallize the logical structure and expand on that initial nugget. Logical Operations are the **only entities we are interested in here**.

## Core Documents

### 1. LOGICAL-OPERATION-EXTRACTION.md
**Comprehensive extraction methodology** covering:
- The extraction process (Chunk → Logical Operation)
- The three components: Clauses, Predicates, Relations
- Extraction methodology with examples
- Key principles for extraction

**Use this for**: Understanding the full extraction process and methodology.

### 2. EXTRACTION-TEMPLATE.md
**Quick reference template and checklist** providing:
- Extraction checklist
- Template structure
- Common patterns
- What NOT to extract
- Complete example

**Use this for**: Quick reference when extracting Logical Operations.

### 3. LOGICAL-EXTRACTION-GUIDE.md
**Guide on what is "Logical" vs what is not** covering:
- What is Logical (structure, relationships, transitions, operations)
- What is NOT Logical (historical references, examples, commentary, descriptions)
- The extraction process
- Examples of logical vs non-logical content

**Use this for**: Understanding what to extract and what to ignore.

## Key Principles

1. **Extract ONLY what is Logical**: Focus on logical structure, relationships, transitions, operations
2. **Crystallize the Logical Structure**: Make the logical structure explicit and clear
3. **Expand on the Initial Nugget**: Build from the logical core outward
4. **Ignore Academic Extras**: Don't extract historical references, examples, commentary unless they reveal logical structure
5. **Build the Logical Graph**: Relations should build a coherent logical graph structure

## Quick Start

1. **Read** `LOGICAL-EXTRACTION-GUIDE.md` to understand what is Logical
2. **Use** `EXTRACTION-TEMPLATE.md` as a quick reference
3. **Follow** `LOGICAL-OPERATION-EXTRACTION.md` for the full methodology
4. **Extract** Logical Operations from Chunks
5. **Expand** on the initial nugget in subsequent operations

## The Goal

**Extract what is Logical from the Science of Logic**—crystallize it, and expand on that initial nugget. Logical Operations are the **only entities we are interested in here**. They are the **pure logical structure** extracted from Hegel's text, ready to be expanded into executable code.
