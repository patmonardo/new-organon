# Objective Logic: Never Self-Determining

## The Key Insight

**The Objective Logic is never self-determining.**

## The Structure

**Concrete existence points to Appearance and Thing**

These are:
- **Objective Reflections**
- **Not self-determining**

## Why This Matters

1. **Objective Logic** = Not self-determining
2. **Appearance and Thing** = Objective Reflections
3. **Concrete existence** = Points to these Objective Reflections
4. **Not self-determining** = Key distinction

## The Connection

**Objective Logic:**
- Appearance
- Thing
- Objective Reflections
- **Never self-determining**

**Subjective Logic (Concept):**
- Self-determining
- The Concept determines itself
- Idea recognizes itself

## The Distinction

**Objective Logic** (Being, Essence):
- Not self-determining
- Appearance and Thing are Objective Reflections
- Concrete existence points to these
- **Never self-determining**

**Subjective Logic** (Concept):
- Self-determining
- The Concept determines itself
- Idea recognizes itself
- **Self-determining**

## In the Text

From `cognition.txt` - Definition:
- "Still given objectivity" - points to Objective Logic
- "Transformed into simple form" - but still not self-determining
- "Concrete existence" - points to Appearance and Thing
- These are Objective Reflections, not self-determining

## The Flow

**Objective Logic (Not Self-Determining)**
- Appearance
- Thing
- Objective Reflections
- Concrete existence points to these

**Subjective Logic (Self-Determining)**
- Concept
- Judgment
- Syllogism
- Idea

## Notes

- This is a key distinction
- Objective Logic = never self-determining
- Concrete existence = Appearance and Thing = Objective Reflections
- Only in Subjective Logic (Concept) do we get self-determination
- The Idea is where self-determination is fully realized
