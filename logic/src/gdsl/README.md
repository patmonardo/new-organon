# GDSL: Graph Dialectical Schema Language

**GDSL = Next Level Dialectic Schema + OpenCypher AST**

GDSL is the **daemon language** between Rust GDS Kernel and TypeScript Logic—the **Reflective System of Marks** that enables syntax-free dialectical computation.

## Architecture

```
Rust GDS Kernel (Graph Data Science)
    ↕ [GDSL Daemon - Pure IR, No Syntax]
TypeScript Logic (UserSpace)
```

**GDSL = SystemD's Bourne Shell (but syntax-free)**
- AI codegens directly in IR (no syntax parsing needed)
- Pure dialectical schema as executable logic
- OpenCypher ASTs as intermediate representation

## Core Concept

GDSL is built on `schema/dialectic.ts` but elevates it to:
- **OpenCypher AST integration**: Dialectic states → Cypher patterns
- **Reflective System of Marks**: PropertyState "Rights" in Essence/Reflection/Ground
- **Dharmic/Legal Language**: What Essence actually is—the language of essential relations

## Structure

- `schema/`: Dialectical schema definitions (extends `schema/dialectic.ts`)
- `ast/`: OpenCypher AST intermediate classes
- `marks/`: Reflective System of Marks (PropertyState Rights)
- `daemon/`: TS ↔ Rust bridge layer
- `reflection/`: Reflection support for dialectical computation

## SDSLs (Special DSLs)

SDSLs are written **presupposing** the dialectical schema of GDSL:
- MVC implements SDSLs for Knowledge Apps
- Each SDSL operates on a "slice of Being"
- GDSL is the **Global Being language**

## Essence/Reflection/Ground

In Essence, GDSL becomes:
- **PropertyState "Rights"**: Legal/Dharmic language
- **Reflective System of Marks**: Essential relations
- **Ground**: The foundation that makes reflection possible
