Kant's "Remark II" touches on a crucial aspect of his philosophy, particularly concerning the limitations and nature of human cognition. Let's break down this passage to understand its implications:

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**Remark II.** **The following important comment suggests itself here: namely, that there are three kinds of antinomy of pure reason, which, however, all coincide in this, that they force reason to give up the otherwise very natural presupposition that holds objects of the senses to be things in themselves, and rather to count them as appearances, and ascribe to them an intelligible substratum (something supersensible, the concept of which is only an idea and permits no genuine cognition).**

1.  **Three Kinds of Antinomy**: Kant refers to three types of conflicts (antinomies) within pure reason. These antinomies arise when reason reaches contradictory conclusions when it tries to go beyond possible experience and comprehend the totality of phenomena (e.g., the beginning of the universe, the nature of causality).

2.  **Natural Presupposition**: He notes that the natural tendency of human reason is to assume that the objects we perceive through our senses are things in themselves (that is, they exist independently of our perception).

3.  **Appearance vs. Thing-in-Itself**: Kant argues that these antinomies force us to reconsider this assumption. Instead of viewing sensory objects as things in themselves, we should regard them as appearances. This implies that what we perceive is not the ultimate reality but a representation shaped by our cognitive faculties.

4.  **Intelligible Substratum**: He suggests that there is an underlying reality (a "supersensible" or "intelligible substratum") behind these appearances. However, this reality is only an idea and cannot be known through empirical means or genuine cognition.

**Without such an antinomy reason would never be able to decide on the assumption of a principle that so narrows the field of its speculation and on sacrifices in which so many otherwise shining hopes must entirely disappear;**

5.  **Purpose of Antinomies**: The role of these antinomies is to push reason towards a crucial realization. Without encountering these contradictions, reason would never adopt a principle that limits its speculative reach. This limitation, although it might seem like a sacrifice, is essential for avoiding erroneous conclusions about the nature of reality.

**for even now, when in compensation for these losses an all the greater employment opens up for it in a practical respect, it seems unable to depart from those hopes and to free itself from its old dependency without pain.**

6.  **Practical Compensation**: Although reason must give up some speculative ambitions, it gains a greater role in practical philosophy. This shift from speculative to practical reason allows for a deeper engagement with moral and ethical concerns.

7.  **Difficulty of Transition**: Kant acknowledges the difficulty reason faces in letting go of its speculative hopes. This transition involves a painful process of breaking free from old dependencies and habits of thought.

### Summary and Implications

Kant's remark illustrates a critical juncture in his philosophy where pure reason is compelled to recognize its limitations. The antinomies, by highlighting the contradictions in speculative reason, force a reevaluation of our understanding of sensory objects and their relation to the underlying reality. This leads to the crucial distinction between appearances (phenomena) and things in themselves (noumena).

By accepting this distinction, reason can avoid futile speculations about the ultimate nature of reality, focusing instead on practical matters where it can achieve genuine knowledge and make significant contributions to human understanding and ethical life. This transition, while difficult, marks a necessary evolution in the use of reason.

That there are three kinds of antinomy is grounded in the fact that there are three cognitive faculties – understanding, the power of judgment, and reason – each of which (as a higher cognitive faculty) must have its a priori principles; for then reason, insofar as it judges concerning these principles themselves and their use, unremittingly demands with regard to all of them the unconditioned for the given conditioned, which, however, can never be found if one considers the sensible as belonging to the things in themselves rather than ascribing to it, as mere appearance, something supersensible (the intelligible substratum of nature outside us and within us) as a thing in itself. There is then 1) an antinomy of reason with regard to the theoretical use of the understanding extending to the unconditioned for the faculty of cognition; 2) an antinomy of reason with regard to the aesthetic use of the power of judgment for the feeling of pleasure and displeasure; 3) an antinomy with regard to the practical use of reason, which is intrinsically self-legislative, for the faculty of desire, to the extent that all these faculties have their higher principles a priori, and, in accordance with an inescapable requirement of reason, must also be able to judge and determine their object unconditionally in accordance with these principles. This section of Kant's remark elaborates on the nature and origin of the three kinds of antinomy he previously mentioned. Let's analyze it line by line to understand its implications:

### Line-by-Line Analysis

**That there are three kinds of antinomy is grounded in the fact that there are three cognitive faculties – understanding, the power of judgment, and reason – each of which (as a higher cognitive faculty) must have its a priori principles;**

1.  **Three Cognitive Faculties**: Kant identifies three primary faculties of cognition: understanding, judgment, and reason. Each of these faculties operates based on principles that are known a priori (independent of experience).

2.  **A Priori Principles**: These faculties each have their own a priori principles, which are fundamental rules or concepts that structure our experience and knowledge.

**for then reason, insofar as it judges concerning these principles themselves and their use, unremittingly demands with regard to all of them the unconditioned for the given conditioned, which, however, can never be found if one considers the sensible as belonging to the things in themselves rather than ascribing to it, as mere appearance, something supersensible (the intelligible substratum of nature outside us and within us) as a thing in itself.**

3.  **Demand for the Unconditioned**: Reason, when reflecting on these principles and their application, seeks the unconditioned basis for any given conditioned reality. This is a pursuit of an ultimate, foundational principle that does not depend on anything else.

4.  **Limitation of Sensible Knowledge**: This unconditioned basis cannot be found if we treat sensory objects (the sensible) as things in themselves. Instead, we must recognize them as mere appearances, with their true nature being something supersensible (intelligible substratum).

5.  **Supersensible Substratum**: The true, underlying reality is the intelligible substratum that lies beyond sensory experience. It is the thing in itself, which cannot be directly known through empirical means but is necessary to account for the coherence of our experiences.

**There is then 1) an antinomy of reason with regard to the theoretical use of the understanding extending to the unconditioned for the faculty of cognition;**

6.  **Antinomy in Theoretical Use**: The first antinomy arises in the theoretical use of the understanding, which seeks to extend knowledge to the unconditioned basis of cognition. This involves conflicts when reason attempts to comprehend the totality of conditions.

**2) an antinomy of reason with regard to the aesthetic use of the power of judgment for the feeling of pleasure and displeasure;**

7.  **Antinomy in Aesthetic Use**: The second antinomy occurs in the aesthetic use of the power of judgment, particularly in relation to feelings of pleasure and displeasure. This reflects the tension between subjective aesthetic experiences and the universal principles we seek to apply to them.

**3) an antinomy with regard to the practical use of reason, which is intrinsically self-legislative, for the faculty of desire, to the extent that all these faculties have their higher principles a priori, and, in accordance with an inescapable requirement of reason, must also be able to judge and determine their object unconditionally in accordance with these principles.**

8.  **Antinomy in Practical Use**: The third antinomy concerns the practical use of reason, particularly in its role as self-legislative. This involves conflicts between the moral law (an a priori principle) and the pursuit of desires, highlighting the challenge of applying unconditional moral principles to concrete situations.

### Summary and Implications

Kant's exposition here highlights the intrinsic conflicts (antinomies) that arise within pure reason as it seeks to extend its principles beyond the limits of possible experience. These antinomies reflect deeper issues within the three faculties of cognition—understanding, judgment, and reason—each striving to apply its a priori principles unconditionally.

-   **Understanding**: Faces antinomies when reason attempts to comprehend the ultimate basis of theoretical knowledge.
-   **Judgment**: Encounters conflicts in the realm of aesthetics, where subjective aesthetic experiences of beauty and taste resist universal categorization.
-   **Reason**: Struggles in its practical application, particularly in reconciling moral imperatives with the desires and conditions of practical life.

These antinomies ultimately force a reconsideration of the assumptions about the nature of sensory objects and the scope of human cognition, pushing reason to recognize its limits and the necessity of an intelligible substratum behind appearances. This shift is crucial for Kant's critical philosophy, as it underscores the boundaries of human knowledge and the importance of practical reason in navigating these limitations.

With regard to two antinomies of those higher cognitive faculties, that of the theoretical and that of the practical employment, we have already shown elsewhere their unavoidability if judgments of this kind do not look back to a supersensible substratum of the given objects, as appearances, but also their resolvability as soon as the latter happens. Now as far as the antinomy in the use of the power of judgment and the resolution of it given here are concerned, there is no other means for avoiding it than either to deny that the aesthetic judgment of taste is grounded on any principle a priori, so that all claim to the necessity of universal assent is a groundless, empty delusion, and a judgment of taste deserves to be held to be correct only insofar as it happens that many people agree about it, and even this, strictly speaking, not because one suspects an a priori principle behind this consensus, but rather (as in the taste of the palate) because the subjects are contingently organized in the same way; or one must assume that the judgment of taste is really a concealed judgment of reason about the perfection that is revealed in a thing and the relation of the manifold in it to an end, so that it is called aesthetic only on account of the confusion that attaches to this reflection of ours, although at bottom it is teleological – in which case one could declare the resolution of the antinomy by means of transcendental ideas to be unnecessary and void, and thus unite those laws of taste with the objects of the senses not as mere appearances but also as things in themselves. But how little the one as well as the other subterfuge succeeds has been shown in several places in the exposition of the judgments of taste.

But if it is conceded that our deduction is at least on the right track, even if it has not been made clear enough in every detail, then three ideas are revealed: first, that of the supersensible in general, without further determination, as the substratum of nature; second, the very same thing, as the principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature for our faculty of cognition; third, the very same thing, as the principle of the ends of freedom and principle of the correspondence of freedom with those ends in the moral sphere.
